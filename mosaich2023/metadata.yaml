  abstract:
    en: "MOSAiCH is a cross-sectional survey that focuses on the Swiss population’s\
      \ values and attitudes towards a wide range of social issues. The thematic focus\
      \ of the 2023 edition lies on National Identity and Citizenship, defined by\
      \ the 2023 module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) which\
      \ is a combination of the earlier National Identity and Citizenship Modules\
      \  (http://www.issp.org). This international part is supplemented by selected\
      \ socio-demographic questions, as well as a module composed of questions specific\
      \ to Switzerland. The questions of this Swiss part are selected through a public\
      \ call, either expanding the ISSP module thematically or measuring other dimensions\
      \ that are of special interest to Switzerland. \n\nTopics: \n- National Identity\
      \ and Citizenship (ISSP 2023), including international optional questions \n\
      - Sociodemographics (education, work, income, household composition, religion,\
      \ nationality, etc.) \n- Questions from 4 different proposals from the call\
      \ on: \n1) Immigration Misperceptions: Exploring their nature and drivers \n\
      2) Intentionalism in Sociological Attitudes towards Immigrants \n3) Nationalism,\
      \ Identification to one’s country, and Meaning in life \n4) National and Supranational\
      \ Collective Narcissism, Identity, and Immigration Attitudes. "
