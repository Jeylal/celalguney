## Welcome ! 👋

My name is Celâl and I am a social sciences researcher in macroeconomics, political economy and survey data analysis. I specialize in the analysis of macroeconomic dynamics, socio-political expectations/preferences, institutional change and in programming, especially with R. I have a background in economics, political economy and economic history as well as in data analysis and applied research in economics with R and other tools such as Stata, SPSS or Julia. My field of interest concerns the analysis of institutional change of contemporary socio-economic models such as the French and Swiss models. I am also interested in the analysis of demand and productivity regimes from a post-Keynesian perspective and in comparative capitalisms.

I am actively looking for job opportunities in research and/or teaching so do not hesitate to have a look to my  [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeylal/celalguney/master/cv.pdf), to my current  [research projects](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/research.html), or to my blog [posts](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/), where I publish stuff related to my studies, readings and research interests. You can have a look to my master's thesis [here](https://jeylal.github.io/master-thesis/), which analyzes institutional change in Switzerland by exploring the political demands of Swiss citizen since the 80s and by offering a clustering analysis of the Swiss socio-political groups in the 90s.
