## Welcome !

My name is Cel√¢l and I am a social sciences researcher in economics, macroeconomics and survey data analysis. I am an expert in the analysis of macroeconomic dynamics, socio-political expectations/preferences, institutional change and in programming, especially with R. I am currently a research and teaching assistant at the department of History-Economics-Society at the University of Geneva, where I obtained a master in Political economy and a certificate in Applied Statistics. I have several years of experience in data analysis and applied research in economics with R and other tools such as Stata, SPSS or Julia.

Since my contract will end next June, I am actively looking for an internship, a Phd position or a job linked to my studies and areas of expertise, so don't hesitate to have a look to my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeylal/celalguney/master/cv.pdf) or to my blog [posts](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/) where I publish stuff related to my studies, readings and research interests. You can have a look to my master's thesis [here](https://jeylal.github.io/master-thesis/), which analyzes institutional change in Switzerland and the political demands of Swiss citizen since the 80s and offers a clustering analysis of the Swiss socio-political groups in the 90s.
