# Welcome !

My name is Cel√¢l and I am a master student in the Political Economy of Capitalism in the University of Geneva. You can have a look to my [CV](https://github.com/Jeylal/myblog/raw/master/Cel%C3%A2l%20G%C3%BCney%20cv%20english.pdf) or to my blog [posts](https://jeylal.github.io/myblog/) where I publish stuff related to my studies, readings and research interests.

My current project at the moment is my master thesis, which will surely be about the political economy of political cleavages in Switzerland. You can have a look to the first draft of my master thesis proposal [here](https://github.com/Jeylal/myblog/raw/master/master%20thesis%20proposal%20celal%20guney.pdf), which will be subject to frequent improvements.
