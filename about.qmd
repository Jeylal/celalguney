# Welcome !

My name is Cel√¢l and I am a master's student in the Political Economy of Capitalism at the University of Geneva. I specialize in macroeconomics, post-Keynesian economics and in data science. I am also interested in econometrics, economic history, the history of economic ideas and theories and in programming, especially with R. My master's studies are coming to an end this June, when I will defend my [master thesis](Social-Blocs,-Institutional-Change-and-Social-Conflict-in-Switzerland.pdf), which is about institutional change in Switzerland. I am currently looking for an internship, a Phd position or a job linked to my studies and interests, so don't hesitate to have a look to my [CV](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/CV.html) or to my blog [posts](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/) where I publish stuff related to my studies, readings and research interests.
