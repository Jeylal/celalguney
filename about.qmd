# Welcome !

My name is Cel√¢l and I am a master student in the Political Economy of Capitalism at the University of Geneva. You can have a look to my [CV](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/CV.html) or to my blog [posts](https://jeylal.github.io/celalguney/) where I publish stuff related to my studies, readings and research interests.

My current project at the moment is my master thesis, which is about the socio-economic determinants behind the evolution of social blocs and capitalism in Switzerland. You can have a look to the progress of my master thesis [here](Social-Blocs,-Political-Cleavages-and-Institutional-Change-in-Switzerland-1.pdf).
