Over the period 1975–95, countries that experienced relatively large declines in union density also experienced relatively large increases in earnings inequality. In addition, governments apparently became less willing to engage in ‘compensatory redistribution’ in these countries. Since the early 1990s, however, union decline has become less closely associated with rising earnings inequality and redistributive policy changes. I argue that the declining relevance of unionization has to do with changes in the position of union members in the income distribution. In most {OECD} countries, the average union member has become relatively better off as union density has declined and union members have probably become less supportive of wage solidarity and redistributive government policies.},

	shorttitle = {Conceptualizing Capitalism},
	abstract = {A few centuries ago, capitalism set in motion an explosion of economic productivity. Markets and private property had existed for millennia, but what other key institutions fostered capitalism’s relatively recent emergence? Until now, the conceptual toolkit available to answer this question has been inadequate, and economists and other social scientists have been diverted from identifying these key institutions. With Conceptualizing Capitalism, Geoffrey M. Hodgson offers readers a more precise conceptual framework. Drawing on a new theoretical approach called legal institutionalism, Hodgson establishes that the most important factor in the emergence of capitalism—but also among the most often overlooked—is the constitutive role of law and the state. While private property and markets are central to capitalism, they depend upon the development of an effective legal framework. Applying this legally grounded approach to the emergence of capitalism in eighteenth-century Europe, Hodgson identifies the key institutional developments that coincided with its rise. That analysis enables him to counter the widespread view that capitalism is a natural and inevitable outcome of human societies, showing instead that it is a relatively recent phenomenon, contingent upon a special form of state that protects private property and enforces contracts. After establishing the nature of capitalism, the book considers what this more precise conceptual framework can tell us about the possible future of capitalism in the twenty-first century, where some of the most important concerns are the effects of globalization, the continuing growth of inequality, and the challenges to America’s hegemony by China and others.},

Comment expliquer que les innovations financières aient d'abord accéléré la croissance avant de déboucher sur une crise majeure ? L'euro, supposé unifier le vieux continent, ne creuse-t-il pas une fracture Nord-Sud ? La théorie de la régulation répond à ces questions. Lors de sa création, dans les années 1970, elle a emprunté à Marx l'analyse de la dynamique du capitalisme, à l'école des Annales la nécessité d'une mise en perspective historique longue, aux post-keynésiens les outils de la macroéconomie. Depuis, elle n'a pas cessé de retravailler ses concepts, ses méthodes, et d'étendre son champ d'application. Aujourd'hui, sous l'hypothèse fondatrice du rôle déterminant des institutions et de leur architecture, elle est une économie politique qui explique les régimes de croissance stabilisée et leurs crises, avec une attention particulière à l'articulation de l'économique et du politique. Cet ouvrage expose les notions centrales de la théorie de la régulation en les situant par rapport aux théories orthodoxes, mais aussi aux différentes alternatives hétérodoxes.

	shorttitle = {Latent Class Modeling with Covariates},
	abstract = {Researchers using latent class ({LC}) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an {LC} model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to {LCs} based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood ({ML})—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step {ML} method can be easily implemented in software for {LC} analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their {SEs} can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the {ML} method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step {ML} estimation.},

	abstract = {Relying on post-election surveys, we analyze how class and union membership condition voters’ abandonment of mainstream Left parties and the alternatives chosen by former mainstream-Left voters in the period 2001–2015. Inspired by Przeworski and Sprague’s Paper Stones (1986), our analysis shows that Left parties face a trade-off between mobilizing workers and other voters and that unionization renders workers more loyal to Left parties that mobilize non-workers. By contrast, unionization does not render non-workers more loyal to Left parties that mobilize workers. Union membership increases the likelihood that workers who abandon the mainstream Left continue to vote. It also increases the likelihood that voters abandon the mainstream Left in favor of radical Left parties rather than Center-Right parties. Finally, we show that workers are more likely to abandon mainstream Left parties in favor of radical Right parties than non-workers and that union membership does not affect their propensity to do so. We conclude that reversing the decline of working-class organization should be a long-term objective of mainstream Left parties.},
