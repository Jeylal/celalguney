What follows is a short demonstration on how to do choropleth map in R studio and was part of a bonus task of a practical of one of my master's courses on applied methods with R. I tried to do some maps and the result was good despite the fact that It can take a long time to figure out how to do. This post is thus for anyone who wants to see how maps can be done on R studio without wasting too much time.

```{r}
#| label = "set-up",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| include = FALSE

rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggmosaic)
library(knitr)
setwd("F:/myblog/posts/Some data analysis and how to do a map with r")
data_qog <- read_csv("2022-10-31-T412006-assignment2-data.csv")
```

# Choropleth maps

Let's try to do some maps to visualize some of the dataset variables

I first load the packages required to do maps on r.

```{r}
#| label = "BT 1",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
library(rgdal)
library(countrycode)
library(gganimate)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(maps)
library(maptools)
library(rgeos)
library(biscale)
library(cowplot)

map <- readOGR("F:/myblog/posts/Some data analysis and how to do a map with r/world map")#Note: the shapefile for the world map was downloaded in the naturalearth website: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
```

To plot maps, a shapefile is required. I downloaded mine from [Natural earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).

I then have to "fortify" the map data to make it tidyverse compatible

```{r}
#| label = "BT 2"
map_fortify <- fortify(map, region = "SOVEREIGNT")
unique(map_fortify$id)
```

The biggest problem to plot a map will be the names of all the countries in the two datasets because I have to successfully join the dataset to the map-dataset, I have to recode the name in one dataset. The package countrycode will do most of the work, but some countries still need to be recoded.

```{r}
#| label = "BT 3",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
data_qog$cname <- countryname(data_qog$cname, destination = "cldr.short.en")
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "US"] <- "United States of America"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "UK"] <- "United Kingdom"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "Congo - Kinshasa"] <- "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "Côte d’Ivoire"] <- "Ivory Coast"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname ==  "Tanzania"] <- "United Republic of Tanzania"
```

I join the datasets by the country names:

```{r}
#| label = "BT 4"
map_join <- map_fortify %>%
  left_join(data_qog, by = c("id" = "cname"))
```

Are military expenditure geographically related to the probability of a country to be autocratic? I will explore with two maps the relation between p_polity and wdi_expmil. I expect countries with high military expenditure to be more autocratic.

I then plot the first map with the variable p_polity2:

```{r}
#| label = "BT 5",
#| fig.align = "center",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
map_join %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = factor(p_polity2), color = I("black"))+
  geom_polygon()+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_ordinal(
          guide = guide_legend(
            direction = "horizontal",
            title.position = 'top',
            title.hjust = 0.5,
            label.hjust = 1,
            nrow = 1,
            byrow = TRUE,
            reverse = TRUE,
            label.position = "bottom"
          ),
          option = "magma",
          name = "p_polity2 index"
      )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()
        )+
  labs(title = "Revised combined polity score across countries (2015)")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("") -> map_plot

map_plot
```

The more democratic countries in 2015 are concentrated in western Europe, America, East and East/South East Asia (Indonesia, Japan, South Korea), South Pacific and India and Mongolia. The autocratic countries tend to be in Africa, Middle East, some in east Europe and South Asia.

I now plot the second map military expenditure wdi_expmil:

```{r}
#| label = "BT 6",
#| fig.align = "center",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
map_join %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = wdi_expmil, color = I("black"))+
  geom_polygon()+
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("")+
  scale_fill_viridis(
          option = "magma",
          direction = -1,
          name = "Military expenditure (% of GDP)"
      )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()
        )+
  labs(title = "Military expenditure in 2015",
       caption = "All current and capital expenditures on the armed forces")
```

Seeing the latter map on military expenditure, I would conclude that there is no clear inverse correlation between degree of democracy and military expenditure: there are countries which are strongly democratic which have relatively high military expenditure such as the US. A lot of African countries are autocratic, but do not have a really high military expenditure except for Algeria and South Sudan. The only region for which there is a correlation between autocracy and military expenditure seems to be Middle East, with Saudi Arabia being the best illustration.
