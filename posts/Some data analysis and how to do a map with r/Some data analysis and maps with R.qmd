# Data transformations

```{r}
#| label = "question 6.1"
typeof(data_qog$ht_region)
is.numeric(data_qog$ht_region)
```
Variable ht_region is stored as a numerical variable. This does not make sense, because the variable is a geographical classification of world region from 1 to 10 each number representing a region, it should hence be stored as a nominal/factor variable.

```{r}
#| label = "question 6.2"
data_qog$ht_region <-  factor(data_qog$ht_region, levels = c(1:10))
unique(data_qog$ht_region)
head(data_qog)
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 7"
data_cntr_reg <- data_qog %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  select(cname, ht_region)
head(data_cntr_reg)
```


## Recoding the regions
```{r}
#| label = "question 10"
data_cntr_reg %>% 
  mutate(
    my_region = ifelse(ht_region %in% c(2, 10), "Americas",
                        ifelse(cname %in% c("Canada", "United States of America (the)"), "Americas",
                          ifelse(ht_region %in% c(6, 7, 8) | cname %in% c("Tajikistan", "Turkmenistan", "Uzbekistan", "Kazakhstan", "Kyrgyzstan"), "Asia",
                              ifelse(ht_region %in% c(1, 5), "Europe",
                                     ifelse(ht_region == 3 | cname %in% c("Turkey", "Israel", "Cyprus"), "North Africa & Middle East (including Israel, Turkey & Cyprus)",
                                            ifelse(ht_region == 4, "Sub-Saharan Africa",
                                                   ifelse(ht_region == 9 | cname %in% c("Australia", "New-Zealand"), "The Pacific (including Australia & New-Zealand", 0)))))))
  ) -> data_cntr_reg

data_cntr_reg %>% 
  arrange(ht_region, cname) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Countries and their region")

```

```{r}
#| label = "question 11"
data_qog <- data_qog %>% 
  mutate(
    my_region = ifelse(ht_region %in% c(2, 10), "Americas",
                        ifelse(cname %in% c("Canada", "United States of America (the)"), "Americas",
                            ifelse(ht_region %in% c(6, 7, 8) | cname %in% c("Tajikistan", "Turkmenistan", "Uzbekistan", "Kazakhstan", "Kyrgyzstan"), "Asia",
                              ifelse(ht_region %in% c(1, 5), "Europe",
                                     ifelse(ht_region == 3 | cname %in% c("Turkey", "Israel", "Cyprus"), "North Africa & Middle East (including Israel, Turkey & Cyprus)",
                                            ifelse(ht_region == 4, "Sub-Saharan Africa",
                                                   ifelse(ht_region == 9 | cname %in% c("Australia", "New-Zealand"), "The Pacific (including Australia & New-Zealand", 0)))))))
  )
  
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 12"
my_gnicapcon2010 <- data_qog %>% 
  select(cname, wdi_pop, wdi_gnicon2010, wdi_gnicapcon2010) %>% 
  mutate(my_gnicapcon = wdi_gnicon2010/wdi_pop)
head(my_gnicapcon2010)
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 13"
data_gnipc <- my_gnicapcon2010 %>% 
    mutate(check = ifelse(my_gnicapcon == wdi_gnicapcon2010, 0, 1))
head(data_gnipc)
```

```{r}
#| label = "question 14"
data_gnipc %>% 
  count(check) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "check = 0: observations with same values")
```


It does not look like, when check is equal to one, that the values are different. The reason is perhaps because of how the values are rounded: observations with check = 0 have the same rounding and observations with check = 1 are rounded differently.

Let's adjust the check by rounding all observations to the third decimal:
```{r}
#| label = "question 15.1"
data_gnipc <- data_gnipc %>% 
  mutate(check2 = ifelse(round(my_gnicapcon, digits = 3) == round(wdi_gnicapcon2010, digits = 3), 0, 1))
```

I now check doing a table:
```{r}
#| label = "question 15.2"
data_gnipc %>% 
  count(check2) %>% 
  kable(caption = "check2 = 0: observations with same values")
```



# Describing variation


```{r}
#| label = "question 16"
data_qog %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE),
            max = max(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = min(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE),
            IQR = IQR(wdi_internet, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "descriptive statistics for wdi_internet")
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 17"

# the plot for wdi_internet NAs 
data_qog %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(Na = (is.na(wdi_internet))) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage_NA = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(Na == TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Percentage_NA))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_area(fill = "red", alpha = 0.5)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Percentage of NAs of WDI_internet by years")

# Best coverage for the wdi_internet variable
data_qog %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(Na = (is.na(wdi_internet))) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage_NA = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() -> na_analysis_internet

na_analysis_internet %>% 
  filter(Na == TRUE) %>% 
  summarize(best_coverage = min(Percentage_NA),
            best_coverage_year = year[which(Percentage_NA == min(Percentage_NA))]) %>% 
  kable()
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 18",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(y = wdi_internet)+
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.9)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Boxplot of individuals using the Internet (% of population) - wdi_internet")
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 18.1",
#| fig.width = 10,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(y = my_region, x = wdi_internet)+
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.9)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))+
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Individuals using the Internet (% of population) by regions in 2007")+
  xlab("wdi internet")+
  ylab("")
```



## Analysis of variable life expectancy across countries and time (wdi_lifexp)
We want: mean, median, range, variance, sd, IQR and percentage of NA for all dataset

```{r}
#| label = "question 19.1"
data_qog %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_life_exp = mean(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_life_exp = median(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE),
    variance_life_exp = sd(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)^2,
    standard_deviation_life_exp = sd(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR_life_exp = IQR(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_life_exp = min(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_life_exp = max(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Descriptive statistics of wdi_lifexp")
```

### Percentage of NAs
```{r}
#| label = "question 19.2"
data_qog %>% 
  select(wdi_lifexp) %>% 
  count(is.na(wdi_lifexp)) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_NAs = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "NAs of wdi_lifexp")
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 20.1"
data_qog %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(average_wdi_lifexp = mean(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() -> Q20_tibble
head(Q20_tibble)
```

### Plotting average wdi_lifexp with year
```{r}
#| label = "question 20.2",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(average_wdi_lifexp = mean(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = year, y = average_wdi_lifexp)+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Average life expectancy at birth",
       caption = "Average number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life")
```


```{r}
#| label = "question 21",
#| fig.width = 10,
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  group_by(my_region, year) %>% 
  summarize(average_lifexp = mean(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() -> Q21_tibble


data_qog %>% 
  group_by(my_region, year) %>% 
  summarize(average_lifexp = mean(wdi_lifexp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = year, y = average_lifexp, color = my_region, shape = my_region)+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(title = "Average life expectancy at birth",
       caption = "Average number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life")
```

```{r}
#| label = "question 22",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wdi_gdpcapcon2010, y = wdi_lifexp)+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Life expectancy and GDP per capita across countries and time")+
  xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy")
```
There seems to be a positive correlation between GDP per cap and life expectancy.



```{r}
#| label = "question 23.1",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.width = 12
data_qog %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wdi_gdpcapcon2010, y = wdi_lifexp, color = my_region)+
  geom_point(alpha = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  labs(title = "Life expectancy and GDP per capital across countries and time")+
   xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy")
```
- Region with low GDP per cap and low life expectancy tends to be Sub-Saharan Africa
- Regions with high GDP per cap and high life expectancy tend to be Europe and America
- Regions for which life expectancy tend to be relatively lower than their GDP per cap is North Africa & Middle East and some countries of Sub-Saharan Africa

North Africa and Middle East is an interesting case whose observations stand out in the graph above. Around 50000 gdp per cap, life expectancy seems to even decrease with gdp per cap. Thus, I am going to include several variable to see any pattern.


I reproduce the graph by adding two variables: br_dem and wdi_expmil, my guess is that countries which are democratic and with few military expenditures are expected to have high GDP PC and high life expectancy (for example because less money in invested in the military and more in health care) and conversely. I expect the countries which had a declining trend in the previous graph to have relatively high military expenditure. I also add lines aesthetics to distinguish countries within the regions.
```{r}
#| label = "question 23.2",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center",
#| fig.width = 18,
#| fig.height = 10
data_qog %>%  
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wdi_gdpcapcon2010, y = wdi_lifexp, color = my_region, shape = factor(br_dem), size = wdi_expmil)+
  geom_line(aes(x = wdi_gdpcapcon2010, y = wdi_lifexp, fill = cname, color = my_region), inherit.aes = FALSE)+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.9)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Military expenditure % of GDP",
                        range = c(0, 15))+
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Is country democratic")+
  labs(title = "Life expectancy and GDP per capital across countries and time")+
  xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy")

```
I can see now that European countries tend to have relatively low military expenditure, have a posititve correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita and tend to be democratic. Sub-Saharan Africa countries tend to have increasing life expectancy over the years, but no important GDP per capita growth. For Asia, There is also a positive correlation between life expectancy and gdp per cap, except for one country. The difference with Europe is that some Asian countries are not democratic (circle = non democratic). North Africa and Middle East is the most intriguing case, with a non democratic country with very high military expenditure and high fluctuation of life expectancy and another non democratic country with negative correlation between life expectancy and GDP per cap. 


```{r}
#| label = "question 24.1"
typeof(data_qog$br_dem)
typeof(data_qog$p_polity2)
range(data_qog$p_polity2, na.rm = TRUE)
```
br_dem (is the country a democracy) is stored as a double, it is however a dummy variable (nominal variable) taking value 0 is country is not democratic and 1 if country is a democracy. Thus, it does not make sense to compute its mean, I should make a table with the frequencies or relative frequencies or do a barplot.

p_polity2 is also stored as a double. It also does not make sense because p_polity2 (revised combined polity score) is an ordinal variable ranging from -10 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic). To give information about this variable, I would do a table and a barplot (sorted according to the range).


I first transform those two variables into factors
```{r}
#| label = "question 24.2"
data_qog$br_dem <- factor(data_qog$br_dem, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Not democratic", "democratic"))

data_qog$p_polity2 <- factor(data_qog$p_polity2, levels = (-10:10))
```


I then do some univariate and bivariate analysis of the variables through tables and a cross table
```{r}
#| label = "question 24.3"
data_qog %>%
  count(p_polity2) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Is the country democratic", align = "c")

data_qog %>% 
  count(br_dem) %>%
  kable(caption = "Is the country democratic", align = "c")
  

kable(table(data_qog$p_polity2, data_qog$br_dem), caption = "Revised combined polity score according to democracy or not")
```

I choose then to do a mosaic plot of p_polity according to br_dem to represent the association of the two variable visually 
```{r}
#| label = "question 25",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(br_dem, p_polity2), fill = br_dem), na.rm = TRUE)+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("Revised Combined Polity Score: from -10 (strongly authocratic) to 10 (strongly democratic)")+
  ggtitle("Revised Combined Polity Score and democracy")

```
I can see that as the Revised Combined Polity Score index on the x axis increases, countries tend to be democratic. The value 4 of Revised Combined Polity Score index seems to be the turning point: before this value, there are more non democratic countries, after the value (4), most of the countries are democratic. However, there still are not democratic countries that have high revised combined polity score, which implies that there is some "disagreement" between the two variable and their definition of what a democracy is (at least for some countries).




Another possiblity is to do a stacked or dodge barplot of p_polity and br_dem
```{r}
#| label = "question 25.2",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
#| fig.align = "center"
data_qog %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = p_polity2, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..), fill = br_dem)+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("Revised Combined Polity Score from -10 (strongly authocratic) to 10 (strongly democratic)")+
  theme_minimal()

data_qog %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = p_polity2, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..), fill = br_dem)+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("Revised Combined Polity Score from -10 (strongly authocratic) to 10 (strongly democratic)")+
  theme_minimal()
```
My analysis is here the same as the previous graph.


# Chloropleth maps

Let's try to do some maps to visualize some of the dataset variables

I first load the packages required to do maps on r
```{r}
#| label = "BT 1",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
library(rgdal)
library(countrycode)
library(gganimate)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(maps)
library(maptools)
library(rgeos)
library(biscale)
library(cowplot)

map <- readOGR("F:/myblog/posts/Some data analysis and how to do a map with r/world map")#Note: the shapefile for the world map was downloaded in the naturalearth website: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
```

I then have to "fortify" the map data to make it tidyverse compatible
```{r}
#| label = "BT 2"
map_fortify <- fortify(map, region = "SOVEREIGNT")
unique(map_fortify$id)
```

The biggest problem to plot a map will be the names of all the countries in the two datasets because I have to successfully join the dataset to the map-dataset, I have to recode the name in one dataset. The package countrycode will do most of the work, but some countries still need to be recoded.
```{r}
#| label = "BT 3",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
data_qog$cname <- countryname(data_qog$cname, destination = "cldr.short.en")
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "US"] <- "United States of America"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "UK"] <- "United Kingdom"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "Congo - Kinshasa"] <- "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname == "Côte d’Ivoire"] <- "Ivory Coast"
data_qog$cname[data_qog$cname ==  "Tanzania"] <- "United Republic of Tanzania"
```

I join the datasets by the country names:
```{r}
#| label = "BT 4"
map_join <- map_fortify %>%
  left_join(data_qog, by = c("id" = "cname"))
```

Are military expenditure geographically related to the probability of a country to be autocratic? I will explore with two maps the relation between p_polity and wdi_expmil. I expect countries with high military expenditure to be more autocratic.

I then plot the first map with the variable p_polity2:
```{r}
#| label = "BT 5",
#| fig.align = "center",
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE
map_join %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = factor(p_polity2), color = I("black"))+
  geom_polygon()+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_ordinal(
          guide = guide_legend(
            direction = "horizontal",
            title.position = 'top',
            title.hjust = 0.5,
            label.hjust = 1,
            nrow = 1,
            byrow = TRUE,
            reverse = TRUE,
            label.position = "bottom"
          ),
          option = "magma",
          name = "p_polity2 index"
      )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()
        )+
  labs(title = "Revised combined polity score across countries (2015)")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("") -> map_plot

map_plot
```
The more democratic countries in 2015 are concentrated in western Europe, America, East and East/South East Asia (Indonesia, Japan, South Korea), South Pacific and India and Mongolia. The autocratic countries tend to be in Africa, Middle East, some in east Europe and South Asia.



I now plot the second map military expenditure wdi_expmil:
```{r}
#| label = "BT 6",
#| fig.align = "center",
#| message = FALSE,

Seeing the latter map on military expenditure, I would conclude that there is no clear inverse correlation between degree of democracy and military expenditure: there are countries which are strongly democratic which have relatively high military expenditure such as the US. A lot of African countries are autocratic, but do not have a really high military expenditure except for Algeria and South Sudan. The only region for which there is a correlation between autocracy and military expenditure seems to be Middle East, with Saudi Arabia being the best illustration.
