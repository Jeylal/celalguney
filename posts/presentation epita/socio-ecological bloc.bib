	abstract = {The International Social Survey Programme ({ISSP}) is a continuous programme of cross-national collaboration running annual surveys on topics important for the social sciences. The programme started in 1984 with four founding members - Australia, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States – and has now grown to almost 50 member countries from all over the world. As the surveys are designed for replication, they can be used for both, cross-national and cross-time comparisons. Each {ISSP} module focuses on a specific topic, which is repeated in regular time intervals. Please, consult the documentation for details on how the national {ISSP} surveys are fielded. The present study focuses on questions about the environment, climate change and environmental protection.},

	abstract = {While the recent extension of the Growth Models perspective to advanced peripheral economies is a laudable endeavor, we argue that the utilization of the social bloc concept needs conceptual refining. We contribute to this debate by drawing explicitly on the writings of Antonio Gramsci. First, we demonstrate that Gramsci differentiated between different forms of state-society complexes in peripheral countries vis-à-vis Western core countries. From a Gramscian perspective, therefore, one might need very different analytical instruments when dealing with the political side of growth models in advanced peripheral economies. Secondly, the widely used notion of intellectual hegemony in civil society—very often associated with Gramsci—refers to the state-society complexes of established capitalist countries and may not necessarily be applied with the same analytical currency in more statist state-society complexes. Our analysis of a variety of Gramscian concepts, which are often overlooked, contributes not only to the study of advanced peripheral economies from a growth model perspective but also to the study of the politics of growth models in general.},

As a complement of this bloc, an 'anti-bourgeois bloc' would gather the social groups excluded from the bloc bourgeois, mainly the working classes. The political representation of this bloc would be unclear, at least in France. During the presidential campaign of 2012, the candidate for the Parti socialiste ({PS}) Francois Hollande made a series of promises that led one to believe that he aimed at a strategy based on the reunification of the left bloc. The strategy of President Hollande, based on a renewed European commitment and neoliberal structural reforms, and that of Marine Le Pen, centred on a return to national sovereignty and the defence of the French model, point to a restructuring of the French political landscape.},

Second, the French political life is characterized by a political crisis: the vanishing of the space for mediation between the divergent expectations of the social groups composing the dominant social bloc. These crises are linked. First, because the institutional reforms undertaken since the 1980s have changed French capitalism, its institutional complementarities, the proﬁle of socio-political groups, and have contributed to destabilizing social alliances. Second, because the political crisis has pushed policy-makers to turn to institutional change as a necessary condition for opening up new spaces of mediation. This contribution surveys the main changes experienced by the French model over the past 30 years, analyses the break-up of the traditional social alliances and presents the elements of the political crisis in relation to neoliberal structural reforms.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a political economy of social conﬂict, institutional change and crises based on the diversity of perceived interests among social groups. The multidimensional conﬂict includes ideology, institutions, and politics. Social groups may be in a dominant or dominated position in one or the other dimension, and the nature of social conﬂict reﬂects the diﬀerences in positions of the various social groups in these dimensions. Political stability hinges on the existence of a dominant social bloc, i.e. a social alliance supporting the ruling political actors. The implementation of institutional change by political actors is driven by the search for support. Crisis situations correspond to the rupture of the dominant social bloc. Attempts to emerge from the crisis with the reconstitution of a dominant social bloc will have more or less chance of success depending on the possibility of ﬁnding a political strategy that can make the expectations of social groups with diﬀerent perceived interests compatible. Using examples from the French and Italian economic and political situations in recent decades, we show how the proposed analytical framework can inform the study of institutional change in situations of social crisis.},

	abstract = {There are many apparent similarities between the current political and economic situations of France and Italy. The mainstream view is that at least part of the neo-liberal strategy could be a solution to the economic problems of both variants of the European model of capitalism. However, the difficulties met by the implementation of these strategies by Sarkozy and Berlusconi lead to believe that the success or failure of neo-liberalisation has less to do with its (lack of) macroeconomic merits than with the stability of the socio-political alliances that support it. In this respect, France and Italy are markedly different. This paper shows that even if the ‘hard core’ of the neoliberal social bloc is roughly the same in both countries, this core constitutes a minority of the electorate; a neoliberal strategy must therefore rely on an extended social coalition, which might not be similar between countries. The Great Recession revealed part of the structural characteristics that set both countries apart. The aim of this article is to show that the consideration of the different socio-political alliances found in each country can help to understand how Italy and France ended up on different economic trajectories.},

The analysis is based on an empirical study of the policy demands of the electorate based on the French electoral survey 2012. A latent class model leads to a partition of the French electorate in eighteen clusters. This analysis sheds light on the composition of the respective social bases of the left and the right as well as on the possibility of existence of the bloc bourgeois.

L'approche choisie par Stefano Palombarini se veut ici résolument pluridisciplinaire. En combinant étude réalisée en termes de sous-systèmes et interrogation sur la spécificité du politique, l'auteur s'emploie à dépasser l'analyse classique, monodisciplinaire, jusqu'alors incapable de prévoir et d'expliquer la crise ouverte de 1992. Comment ignorer en effet l'interaction des sphères de la politique économique, de l'évolution macroéconomique et du soutien électoral pour appréhender une telle situation ? Comment en déchiffrer les mécanismes et les implications ? Le modèle théorique et les scénarios présentés dans ce texte viennent précisément souligner le rôle qu'ont pu jouer à la fois les politiques de court terme et l'exclusion des salariés de la base électorale du gouvernement dans la dynamique italienne. Ainsi, la crise est-elle analysée comme le résultat de l'épuisement endogène des marges de médiation politique entre les différents intérêts que la politique économique rendait initialement compatibles.},

The current situation would be characterised by a dominance of ‘elites’ in left and right constituencies: financially rich elites vote for the right (merchant right), high-education elites vote for the left (brahmin left). Using {ISSP} data for 17 countries, this paper tests the influence of income and education inequalities on political leaning and a variety of policy preferences: the support for redistribution, for investment in public education, for globalisation and immigration. Results show that income levels are still relevant for the left-right divide, but the influence differs across education levels. Our findings also point to a certain convergence of opinion among the Brahmin left and the merchant right, which could lead to a new political divide beyond the left and the right, uniting a bloc bourgeois.},

It has often been criticised for being too static and too functionalist, unable to explain change because it would propose a view of institutional forms fitting perfectly with one another. After having presented the concept and its interest for comparative capitalism, this article argues in favour of its usefulness to explain institutional change. However, in order to be integrated fruitfully into a theory of institutional change, it is necessary to have a political economy definition of complementarity, which should not take institutions as some sort of inputs in a production function, but as socio-political compromises established in historically-specific conditions.},

Il s’appuie sur la science des « Chicago Boys », dont les prix Nobel d’économie ont contribué à légitimer les politiques néo-libérales de Pinochet ; mais il se nourrit aussi d’un idéalisme politique et social qui s’est employé à dénoncer les abus de ces dictatures militaires en se réclamant des droits de l’homme. Sur fond de guerre froide et d’âpres luttes pour le pouvoir, le Chili et l’Argentine sont devenus ainsi le laboratoire explosif d’une modernité politique, qui se sert d’arguments scientifiques et idéologiques pour imposer un nouvel ordre universel, qualifié – de manière appropriée – de « consensus de Washington ».},

Au-delà des afﬁchages, en quoi consisterait une authentique planiﬁcation écologique ? Ce livre propose de revenir sur l'histoire de cette notion au {XXe} siècle, entre économies de guerre et expériences socialistes, de revisiter les débats classiques ayant opposé les adeptes du " signal prix " et ceux du " calcul en nature ", mais aussi de montrer en quoi la situation actuelle est porteuse de possibilités de planiﬁcation nouvelles. Le déploiement maîtrisé des outils numériques, des techniques comptables novatrices et l'approfondissement des institutions de la délibération collective peuvent donner lieu à un gouvernement de la production par les besoins. Tant qu'ils resteront pris dans le carcan du " libre marché ", les écogestes des consommateurs se révéleront impuissants. Ce sont les structures économiques qu'il s'agit de transformer pour réduire l'impact écologique des activités humaines. Face à ce déﬁ, cet ouvrage tente de poser les piliers d'un programme de planiﬁcation écologique fondé sur la décroissance dans l'exploitation de la nature, sur la justice environnementale et sur la démocratie économique.},

But there is a problem: proposals are scattered through a voluminous literature, making it difficult for decision-makers to pinpoint the concrete changes associated with the idea of degrowth. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic mapping of the degrowth literature from 2005 to 2020 using the {RepOrting} standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses ({ROSES}) methodology. Out of a total of 1166 texts (articles, books, book chapters, and student theses) referring to degrowth, we identified 446 that include specific policy proposals. This systematic counting of policies led to a grand total of 530 proposals (50 goals, 100 objectives, 380 instruments), which makes it the most exhaustive degrowth policy agenda ever presented. To render this toolbox more accessible, we divided it into in 13 policy themes – food, culture and education, energy and environment, governance and geopolitics, indicators, inequality, finance, production and consumption, science and technology, tourism, trade, urban planning, and work – systematically making the difference between goals, objectives, and instruments. Following this, we assess the precision, frequency, quality, and diversity of this agenda, reflecting on how the degrowth policy toolbox has been evolving until today.},

The reviewed studies cover different geographical and temporal scopes, economic theories, modeling techniques and operationalizations of {DG}/{PG}. The majority of studies models {DG}/{PG} as intentional transition and does not question its compatibility with a capitalist system, while more radical strands of the {DG}/{PG} discourse are excluded. Although {DG}/{PG} modeling exercises frequently explore the effects of sustainability policies, they represent only a fraction of theoretical {DG} policy proposals, with the most frequent being: working time reduction, maximum income caps, carbon taxes and a universal basic income. {DG}/{PG} modeling studies have demonstrated the importance of integrating biophysical constraints in economic modeling but also have quantitatively assessed the feasibility of environmental integrity and social well-being without growth. Nonetheless, future modeling could be rendered more realistic by paying more attention to the Global South, introducing heterogeneous agents driving sustainability transitions and including multiple planetary boundaries.},

	abstract = {Degrowth and post-growth economics has emerged as a particularly fruitful approach in the debates about the reorientation of economies in the Global North towards environmental sustainability, equality, need satisfaction and democracy. This perspective promotes a planned reduction of energy and resource use in the Global North to limit environmental pressures and global inequalities and improving well-being. Yet, the specifics of this “design” are not precisely delineated. On the one hand, there is a wide acceptance, at the abstract, most general, even definitional level, that degrowth involves planning or amounts to a planned transition. On the other hand, there is strikingly little explicit engagement with, debate on, and research into what exactly “planning beyond growth” could look like. This gap urgently needs to be addressed. By exploring the degrowth-planning nexus, this paper seeks to lay a foundation for this effort. First, it identifies in the degrowth/postgrowth literature the obstacles and the opportunities for further engagement with planning. Second, it advances an agenda-setting framework, delineating problems relative to democratic ecological planning beyond growth along three axis: elaboration, implementation and multilevel dynamics.},

In this article, we reflect on insights from the classic literature on how cleavages structure party systems and consider how the emergence and persistence of new parties and new ideological conflicts are leading to both shifts of dividing lines of party competition and the fragmentation of party systems. While increasing attention has been given to the so-called second dimension of European electoral politics, we highlight the relatively limited focus on structural changes that are helping to drive this transformation. We identify some socio-demographic developments that are potentially generating new cleavages in Western European democracies: the expansion of higher education; mass migration and the growing ethnic diversity of electorates; the aging of societies and sharpening of generational divides; and increased geographical segregation of populations between prospering, globalized major cities and declining hinterlands.},

While research increasingly seeks to model the link between public opinion and environmental policies, the empirical evidence is largely based on a single case: the {US}. This limits the generalizability of findings and we argue accordingly for a systematic, quantitative study of how public opinion drives environmental policies in another context. Theoretically, we combine arguments behind the political survival of democratic leaders with electoral success and environmental politics. Ultimately, we suggest that office-seeking leaders introduce policies that seem favorable to the domestic audience; if the public prefers environmental protection, the government introduces such policies in turn. The main contribution of this research is the cross-country empirical analysis, where we combine data on the public’s environmental attitudes and renewable energy policy outputs in a European context between 1974 and 2015. We show that as public opinion shifts towards prioritizing the environment, there is a significant and positive effect on the rate of renewable energy policy outputs by governments in Europe. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic, quantitative study of public opinion and environmental policies across a large set of countries, and we demonstrate that the mechanisms behind the introduction of renewable energy policies follow major trends across European states.},

Yet political behaviour research often considers environmental attitudes as a component of a broader ‘second-dimension’ and either subsumes it into this or omits it. Using data from the fifth wave of the European Values Study, we demonstrate through factor analysis that environmentalism loads as a separate dimension across Western Europe, that environmentalism has somewhat different social predictors and that it has important associations with party preference that differ from those of other second dimension issues. Our findings have crucial implications. Firstly, not accounting for environmentalism in studies of political behaviour misses an important part of the picture. Secondly, subsuming environmentalism into a broader ‘cultural’ dimension may lead to incomplete conclusions about both social predictors and the electoral consequences of political attitudes and values. Thus, allowing for a separate environmental dimension opens up novel perspectives on political representation in Western democracies.},

	abstract = {{BRUSSELS} — European Green parties on Monday were cheering E.U. elections that vaulted them into a kingmaking position of power, as voters abandoned traditional political parties in favor of climate-focused activists in a green wave that swept several countries.

The results propelled the Greens into second place in Ger many and third place in France and elsewhere, amid a surge in excitement from young voters who faulted old-school parties for ignoring their concerns about the environment and offering few alternatives for a generation beset by economic pain following the global financial crisis.

In an election for the European Parliament in which far-right, anti-immigration buccaneers also gained modestly to post their best-ever result, the good showing for the Greens may have the bigger impact on policy. The center-left and center-right parties that long jointly ruled the parliament have lost their majority, meaning they will need to depend on Greens and other centrists to advance their agenda.

far right, meanwhile, captured about a quarter of the seats, up from a fifth — enough to entrench their angry voices of protest and cause trouble in the legislature, but not enough to actually enact an agenda.

“This is confirmation for us that the topics we’ve been working on for years are the topics that matter to the public in their everyday life and for the future of their children,” said Sergey Lagodinsky, a newly elected Green member of the European Parliament from Germany. “We had times when we wondered: Is this a fringe agenda? Now we know it’s not. It’s the mainstream agenda.”

Many Green parties in Europe have evolved into disciplined political machines with an agenda that extends far beyond the environment.

And they have been particularly successful at capturing energy from young voters. Fridays for Future, a global movement of students who skip school to protest climate inaction, has been active in Europe for months, inspired by a 16-year-old Swedish student, Greta Thunberg, who has become an influential activist.

“The new generation has been re-politicized,” Lagodinsky said. “We thought about these young people as people who only stare at their screens. But they can walk the streets. And that has an impact on their parents and grandparents.”

In some countries, including in Germany, Greens have served in government. But they had never achieved such widespread gains until Sunday’s elections. To some, the result felt like a Green ticket into the European establishment. The party gained 2 percentage points, winning 9 percent of the 751-seat legislature. Although the overall gain was modest — and in Europe’s south and east, they made little progress — they outperformed in several of Europe’s biggest and most influential countries.

“They’ve become mainstream. They have matured enormously. They’re much more disciplined,” said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute, a think tank.

Their appeal to voters goes beyond the environment, she said, after many center-left leaders offered the same mix of austeritydriven fixes for the 2008 economic crisis as that of their center-right rivals.

“Neoliberalism has triumphed in economic policy, with both the center-right and center-left adopting it. And then the economic crisis came along, and the left did not benefit from that,” Grabbe said. “The left did not provide alternatives.”

Green issues have reverberated outward: Leaders from other parties, seeing a Green success bubbling in opinion polls, emphasized climate issues in the campaign.

“Green is not the sole property of the Green Party,” Frans {TimThe} a senior Dutch politician who was the European center-left coalition’s lead candidate, said at a debate last month. He said other political parties — notably his own — were also focusing on the environment.

That will benefit the Greens. As they sweep into Parliament, they will have to team up with others to enact their agenda, as they have already with success inside individual countries.

“In an increasing number of countries, we’re a real player, a real polar force now, and we want to translate that to the European level,” Reinhard Bütikofer, a longtime German Green lawmaker, told an after-election event on Monday.

The Green wave was most pronounced in Germany, where the party has long been a potent political player — even serving for seven years as the junior partner in a coalition government in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

But it had never enjoyed a night like Sunday, when it vaulted into second place nationwide with nearly 21 percent of the vote. The surge for the Greens was mirrored by a collapse for the Social Democrats, traditionally the dominant party on the left of German politics but perhaps now supplanted.

The result followed a string of Green successes in German state elections and reflected a surge in the polls that dates back nearly a year as voters registered their unmermans, happiness with the so-called “grand coalition” between Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats.

But more than a protest vote, Green strength also rests on deep concern in Germany about the state of the planet. German voters told pollsters that the environment was their top concern going into the vote, and that was apparent in the outcome.

Exit polls in Germany showed the Greens to be the overwhelming top choice for young voters and for first-time voters. The party also did especially well in cities, taking voters from the center-left and center-right parties.

Leaders of those two parties acknowledged after the vote that they had been too passive in responding to voter concern about the climate, and they promised to do better. The Greens in Germany have pushed for aggressive action to curb climate change, including an earlier-than-planned phaseout of coal power.

Jürgen Falter, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Mainz, said the onus is now on mainstream parties to show they take the issue seriously. But that approach may have its limits.

“Voters tend to choose the original and not the party that only discusses the issue after many defeats,” Falter said.

In a reflection of just how much the Greens are steering the debate in Germany, far-right Alternative for Germany ({AfD}) leader Alexander Gauland declared that the party was now “our main enemy.”

The {AfD}, which denies the science behind man-made climate change, had a disappointing night on Sunday, failing to match its performance in the 2017 federal elections.

As in Germany, France saw a humiliating loss for the centerleft but surprising gains for the Greens. They came in third place, with approximately 13.5 percent of the vote. The Socialists, by contrast, won only 6.2 percent.

Although the Greens also placed third in 2009, winning 16.3 percent of the vote then, Sunday’s victory came in the context of the near-total flatlining of the older political movements that dominated France for decades.

In France as elsewhere, the left seems not to have died but merely to have changed form. To the extent that a muscular leftist movement exists, it is now green.

“The Greens represent the only project of the future,” French Greens leader Yannick Jadot said Monday on French television.

Climate change, said an editorial in France’s Liberation newspaper, “has become the principal criteria of judging political action in the European Union.”

“We wondered: Is this a fringe agenda? Now we know it’s not. It’s the mainstream agenda.”

	abstract = {Economic growth is both essential and detrimental to modern Global North societies. When growth disappears, or becomes negative, debt overhang, unemployment, impoverishment destabilise societies. But ecological fallout from growth can also undermine societies in the long term. So why and how are economies and societies dependent on growth? Many scholars have conceptualised growth dependence as the need to achieve growth to serve general wellbeing and economic functioning. In this article, we take a different view considering growth as a part of social reproduction, arguing that growth dependence emerges when growth is needed to reproduce a stable regime of power relations. We operationalise this approach using Régulation Theory, a political economy framework anchored in but expanding Marxist political economy, and aimed at explaining how capitalism manages to reproduce itself despite its contradictions. We show that economic institutions and institutional systems (in the language of Régulation theory, structural forms and modes of regulation) depend on growth because they crystallise certain balances of power within so-called “institutionalised compromises”. An economic institution may require varying levels of growth to reproduce itself, depending on the type of compromises it embeds. We propose that, in a given national economy, combinations and interactions between such institutions shape the overall character of growth dependence. Régulation Theory enables us to build a bottom-up analysis - from institutions to the national economy - of growth dependence. This novel conceptualisation opens new and fruitful research opportunities for understanding growth dependence.},

It brings together a range of practices including alternative forms of living and transformative initiatives in civil society, business and the state.

It develops a theory of degrowth transformations drawing on insights from multiple fields of knowledge, such as political economy, sociology and philosophy. The book offers a holistic perspective that brings into focus transformation processes on various scales and points to various mechanisms that can facilitate degrowth. These include, for instance, eco-social policies, transformative initiatives in business and civil society and alternative modes of being in and relating with the world.},

Those who write about degrowth advocate radical policy and social change, but have no model to explain how, why and under what conditions such change could come about and what role the state would play in it. This is because they have no theory of what the state is, or when and why it changes. We review for the first time the Anglophone and Francophone literatures on state and degrowth and find both wanting. We propose a Gramscian theory of the state suitable for thinking about degrowth and show with the example of strategizing for a maximum income policy how this suits the degrowth literature’s emphasis on a combination of grassroots and institutional actions.},

However, an overview taking stock of the peer-refereed degrowth literature is yet missing. Here, we review 91 articles that were published between 2006 and 2015. We find that the academic degrowth discourse occupies a small but expanding niche at the intersection of social and applied environmental sciences. The discourse is shaped by authors from high-income, mainly Mediterranean, countries. Until 2012, articles largely constitute conceptual essays endorsed by normative claims. More recently, degrowth has branched out into modelling, empirical assessments, and the study of concrete implementations. Authors tend to agree in that economic growth cannot be sustained ad infinitum on a resource constraint planet and that degrowth requires far reaching societal change. Whether degrowth should be considered as a collectively consented choice or an environmentally-imposed inevitability constitutes a major debate among degrowth thinkers. We argue that the academic discourse could benefit from rigid hypotheses testing through input-output modelling, material flow analysis, life-cycle assessments, or social surveys. By analyzing the potentials for non-market value creation and identifying concrete well-being benefits, the degrowth discourse could receive wider public support and contribute to a paradigmatic change in the social sciences.},

Degrowth signals a radical political and economic reorganization leading to reduced resource and energy use.

Research on degrowth has reinvigorated the limits to growth debate with critical examination of the historical, cultural, social, and political forces that have made economic growth a dominant objective. Here we review studies of economic stability in the absence of growth and of societies that have managed well without growth. We reflect on forms of technology and democracy com-patible with degrowth and discuss plausible openings for a degrowth transition.

Nous montrons que les différentes formes historiques du capitalisme ont généré des conséquences environnementales importantes et différenciées. À l’inverse, il s’avère que le rapport à l’environnement a eu une influence primordiale sur les formes de capitalisme, notamment par l’intermédiaire de dispositifs institutionnels environnementaux ({DIE}). Le second chapitre vise à savoir dans quelle mesure ces {DIE} subissent un processus d’adoption différencié selon les formes contemporaines de capitalisme dans lesquelles ils s’inscrivent. , une certaine correspondance entre notre typologie des {DIE} nationaux et la typologie des capitalismes d’Amable apparaît. Enfin, le troisième chapitre porte sur la manière dont les niveaux d’inégalités, en grande partie dépendants des différentes formes de capitalismes, peuvent influencer l’adoption des {DIE}.

L’objectif est d’identifier des ruptures dans les modalités d’usage de l’énergie qui accompagnent les transformations observées dans d’autres domaines. Pour cela, nous procédons à une analyse empirique et comparatiste de l’utilisation de l’énergie dans les principales économies à haut revenu (Allemagne, États-Unis, France, Japon et Royaume-Uni) entre 1950 et 2010. Le fordisme se caractérise par une utilisation extensive de l’énergie et une utilisation intensive du travail. Les forts gains de productivité de ce dernier sont alimentés notamment par une augmentation rapide de la quantité d’énergie incorporée au processus de production. À partir de 1970, le ralentissement de la croissance de la quantité d’énergie coïncide avec le ralentissement de la productivité du travail et contribue à l’érosion du compromis social fordiste. L’émergence du néolibéralisme se traduit par une restauration de la part du capital dans le partage de la valeur ajoutée et s’accompagne, d’une part, d’une utilisation de plus en plus intensive de l’énergie, la productivité de celle-ci se mettant à augmenter fortement dans les principaux pays à haut revenu ; d’autre part, par la délocalisation de l’utilisation de l’énergie.},

This analysis challenges traditional views that regard energy primarily as an exogenous shock and instead posits energy as a fundamental metabolic constraint in capitalist accumulation regimes. To demonstrate this, we integrate energy flows into the analysis of capitalists' regimes by crossing two bodies of knowledge: ecological economics and regulation theory. We enrich regulation theory with three key ecological macroeconomics indicators: thermodynamic efficiency, exosomatic metabolic rate and the weight of energy expenditures. Using descriptive statistics, we show that the weight of energy expenditures is the most significant variable: it must be contained if the rate of profit is to be maintained and if capital accumulation is to continue. Neoliberalism responded to the metabolic exhaustion of Fordism but eventually encountered its own limits in managing energy constraints. Neoliberal recipes for reconfiguring the metabolism have generated major imbalances likely to call into question the reproduction of this regime (financial crises, trade imbalances). We conclude that neoliberalism's structural crisis is rooted in the exhaustion of past energy management strategies, opening the door to the emergence of post-liberal capitalism.},

As the social metabolism of our industrial economy increases, intensifying extractive activities and the production of waste, the related social and environmental impacts generate conflicts and resistance across the world. This expansion of global capitalism leads to greater disconnection between the diverse geographies of injustice along commodity chains. Yet, at the same time, through the globalization of governance processes and Environmental Justice ({EJ}) movements, local political ecologies are becoming increasingly transnational and interconnected. We first make the case for the need for new approaches to understanding such interlinked conflicts through collaborative and engaged research between academia and civil society. We then present a large-scale research project aimed at understanding the determinants of resource extraction and waste disposal conflicts globally through a collaborative mapping initiative: The {EJAtlas}, the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice. This article introduces the {EJAtlas} mapping process and its methodology, describes the process of co-design and development of the atlas, and assesses the initial outcomes and contribution of the tool for activism, advocacy and scientific knowledge. We explain how the atlas can enrich {EJ} studies by going beyond the isolated case study approach to offer a wider systematic evidence-based enquiry into the politics, power relations and socio-metabolic processes surrounding environmental justice struggles locally and globally.},

We propose a theory of macrofinancial regimes, understood as combinations of monetary, fiscal, and financial institutions that shape the creation and allocation of credit/money, and hence the speed and nature of the green transition. Focusing on two dimensions—the scale of green public spending and the degree of discipline imposed on private capital—we derive a typology of four regimes. Derisking regimes are low-discipline: under weak derisking, a fiscally constrained state tweaks the risk-return profile on infrastructure assets to reduce the carbon footprint of the economy’s existing sectoral structure; under robust derisking, the state subsidizes capital expenditure in cleantech manufacturing directly, and with the ambition to alter the economy’s sectoral composition. Derisking regimes are rendered unstable by coordination problems and regressive distributional consequences. This may tip societies into a carbon shock therapy regime under which discipline is enforced by carbon prices and market competition, resulting in a disorderly transition path. Alternatively, institutional reforms that increase the state’s capacity to spend and to discipline capital may give rise to a big green state regime where coordination is achieved through state-led planning.},

En recourant à plusieurs méthodes d’analyse de données, il s’agit successivement de mettre en évidence les axes factoriels permettant de structurer cette diversité et de réaliser une typologie des diverses catégories de pays au regard de leurs {DIE}. Une comparaison est alors faite avec la typologie des catégories de capitalisme de Bruno Amable (2005). L’exercice comparatif n’apparaît probant que pour les économies de type libéral et celles qui relèvent du « capitalisme méditerranéen ». Une explication de ce lien paraît pouvoir être apportée par une analyse en termes de complémentarité institutionnelle entre les {DIE} et les formes institutionnelles (ou domaines institutionnels) constituant les formes de capitalisme.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the socio-economic context into which environmental policies and ecological sentiments emerge through empirically studying the relation to the environment of different kinds of capitalism. The association and interaction of the relation to the environment with other key social relations, e.g. the labour-capital relations, are studied and discussed. To achieve this, I draw from Regulation Theory and augment its analytical framework with an explicit environmental dimension. I then conduct an empirical analysis of the diversity of contemporary capitalism including the social relation to the environment for a sample of thirty-seven {OECD} and {BRICS} countries. Five kinds of capitalism are identified: the Northern-continental European, the Southern-central European, the Anglo-Saxon and Pacific, the Emerging Countries and the Two Giants. A main result is the correspondence between social relations to the environment exhibiting ecology-prone socio-political stances and a lower domestic natural resources intensity with labour oriented capital-labour relations, welfare-oriented states and openness to foreign suppliers. However, the results show that countries that are the most ecology-prone are also the ones that have the most relocated their environmental impact, confirming that global capitalism is not an ecological system. Implications of this pattern for a socio-ecological transition are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {The Evolutionary Roots of Our Environmental Problems},
	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that we need to stabilize population growth and reduce our environmental impact; however, there is little consensus about how we might achieve these changes. Here I show how evolutionary analyses of human behavior provide important, though generally ignored, insights into our environmental problems. First, I review increasing evidence that Homo sapiens has a long history of causing ecological problems. This means that, contrary to popular belief, our species’ capacity for ecological destruction is not simply due to “Western” culture. Second, I provide an overview of how evolutionary research can help to understand why humans are ecologically destructive, including the reasons why people often overpopulate, overconsume, exhaust common‐pool resources, discount the future, and respond maladaptively to modern environmental hazards. Evolutionary approaches not only explain our darker sides, they also provide insights into why people cherish plants and animals and often support environmental and conservation efforts (e.g., Wilson’s “biophilia hypothesis”). Third, I show how evolutionary analyses of human behavior offer practical implications for environmental policy, education, and activism. I suggest that education is necessary but insufficient because people also need incentives. Individual incentives are likely to be the most effective, but these include much more than narrow economic interests (e.g., they include one’s reputation in society). Moralizing and other forms of social pressure used by environmentalists to bring about change appear to be effective, but this idea needs more research. Finally, I suggest that integrating evolutionary perspectives into the environmental sciences will help to break down the artificial barriers that continue to divide the biological and social sciences, which unfortunately obstruct our ability to understand ourselves and effectively address our environmental problems.},

While the European Union is not a state, it has not been immune to these processes. Over the last three decades it has expanded its Single European Market and created a currency while constructing European political authority and deepening its institutional capacities. The {EU} has done this through supranational market-making largely centred on neoliberal precepts of competition and openness. Today, however, the {EU} is breaking with that tradition by pursuing a visibly interventionist European industrial policy and geopolitical market strategy. I suggest a theoretical framework to illuminate how this policy turn may reconfigure the {EU}’s political authority and build it as a polity. After briefly identifying the contours of the new European industrial and geoeconomic policy, I outline a research agenda to probe how the new market activism may reformulate societal interests and coalitions, increase the politicisation of the {EU}’s governing institutions, raise the stakes for democratic legitimation, and project the {EU} as a geopolitical actor. The conclusion notes how this new market-making translates into significant policy challenges for both the {EU} and the international economic order.},

Leur analyse repose sur le modèle « World3 », qui permet une simulation informatique des interactions entre population, croissance industrielle, production alimentaire et limites des écosystèmes terrestres.Ce rapport paraît avant la première crise pétrolière de 1973, et pour beaucoup d’esprits, la croissance économique est alors un fait durable, qui ne saurait être discuté. En 2004, les auteurs reprennent leur analyse et l’enrichissent de données accumulées durant trois décennies d’expansion sans limites : l’impact destructeur des activités humaines sur les processus naturels les conforte définitivement dans leur raisonnement.En 1972, la problématique centrale du livre était : « comment éviter le dépassement » ; l’enjeu est désormais : « comment procéder pour que nos activités ralentissent et puissent tenir dans les limites de la planète ».Ce livre propose donc la dernière version du Rapport Meadows, à un moment où la crise majeure que nous traversons jette une lumière crue sur la dynamique de la croissance et ses effets.},

Il s’agit d’un courant de pensée et d’action écologique qui fait siens les acquis fondamentaux du marxisme, tout en le débarrassant de ses scories productivistes.La logique capitaliste du marché et du profit, de même que celle de l’autoritarisme bureaucratique de feu le «socialisme réel », est incompatible avec les exigences de sauvegarde de l’environnement. Les écosocialistes critiquent les impasses actuelles de l’écologie politique, qui ne met pas en question le pouvoir du capital.L’écosocialisme est donc une proposition radicale qui vise non seulement à une transformation des rapports de production, de l’appareil productif et des modèles de consommation dominants, mais aussi à créer un nouveau paradigme de civilisation, en rupture avec les fondements de la civilisation capitaliste/industrielle occidentale moderne.Michael Löwy nous présente les idées de ceux qui souhaitent que « la valeur d’échange soit remplacée par la valeur d’usage », et que « la production soit organisée en fonction des besoins sociaux et des exigences de la protection de l’environnement ».Michael Löwy est né au Brésil (1938) et vit à Paris depuis 1969.

	abstract = {Ecosocialism is an attempt to provide a radical civilizational alternative to what Marx called capitalism's 'destructive progress'. It advances an economic policy founded on the non-monetary and extra-economic criteria of social needs and ecological equilibrium.According to O'Connor, the aim of ecological socialism is a new society based on ecological rationality, democratic control, social equality, and the predominance of use-value over exchange-value. I would add that these aims require: (a) collective ownership of the means of production ('collective' here meaning public, cooperative or communitarian property); (b) democratic planning, which makes it possible for society to define the goals of investment and production, and (c) a new technological structure of the productive forces. In other words, a revolutionary social and economic transformation. For ecosocialists, the problem with the main currents of political ecology, represented by most Green parties, is that they do not seem to take into account the intrinsic contradiction between the capitalist dynamics of the unlimited expansion of capital and accumulation of profits, and the preservation of the environment. This leads to a critique of productivism, which is often relevant, but does not lead beyond an ecologically-reformed 'market economy'. The result has been that many Green parties have become the ecological alibi of center-left social-liberal governments.},

Despite its popularity, there is limited guidance with respect to decisions that must be made when conducting and reporting {LCA}. Moreover, there is a lack of user-friendly open-source implementations. Based on contemporary academic discourse, this paper introduces recommendations for {LCA} which are summarized in the {SMART}-{LCA} checklist: Standards for More Accuracy in Reporting of different Types of Latent Class Analysis. The free open-source R-package package {tidySEM} implements the practices recommended here. It is easy for beginners to adopt thanks to user-friendly wrapper functions, and yet remains relevant for expert users as its models are integrated within the {OpenMx} structural equation modeling framework and remain fully customizable. The Appendices and {tidySEM} package vignettes include tutorial examples of common applications of {LCA}.},

	abstract = {Researchers using latent class ({LC}) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an {LC} model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to {LCs} based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood ({ML})—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step {ML} method can be easily implemented in software for {LC} analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their {SEs} can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the {ML} method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step {ML} estimation.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of a three-step approach to estimating the parameters of a latent structure model for categorical data and propose a simple correction for a common source of bias. Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model.},

Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion ({ICs}) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis ({LCA}), a factor mixture model ({FMA}), and a growth mixture models ({GMM}). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the {ICs}, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.},

The authors argue that, as a result of structural transformations and the strategic repositioning of political parties, Europe has observed the emergence of a tripolar configuration of political power, comprising the left, the moderate right, and the new populist right. They suggest that, through an emphasis on cultural issues such as mass immigration and resistance to European integration, the traditional focus of political debate - the economy - has been downplayed or reinterpreted in terms of this new political cleavage.

Bipolar competition is becoming tripolar, as the two dominant party poles of the twentieth century – the left and the centre-right – are challenged by a third pole of the radical right. Between 2000 and 2015, the radical right has secured more than 12 per cent of the vote in over ten Western European countries. This article shows how electoral competition between the three party poles plays out at the micro level of social classes. It presents a model of class voting that distinguishes between classes that are a party's preserve, classes that are contested strongholds of two parties and classes over which there is an open competition. Using seven rounds of the European Social Survey, it shows that sociocultural professionals form the party preserve of the left, and large employers and managers the preserve of the centre-right. However, the radical right competes with the centre-right for the votes of small business owners, and it challenges the left over its working-class stronghold. These two contested strongholds attest to the co-existence of old and new patterns of class voting. Old patterns are structured by an economic conflict: Production workers vote for the left and small business owners for the centre-right based on their economic attitudes. In contrast, new patterns are linked to the rise of the radical right and structured by a cultural conflict.},

In the theoretical part, we conceptualize classes in social space and mentalities through a Bourdieusian relational approach. We also discuss the location of the four lines of conflict in social space. In the empirical part, we analyze survey data from Germany. Firstly, we find eight mentalities among respondents reflecting their views on various eco-social topics. Secondly, we construct the social space with socio-economic variables for the economic and cultural capital of the respondents. Thirdly, we plot the mentalities in the social space. The results show that the cultural middle class is in favor of eco-social policy, while the upper class and the economic middle class prefer green growth and ecological modernization. The lower-class fractions are skeptical of any transformation because they distrust institutions and cannot bear the transformation costs.},

Item response theory and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were employed to evaluate comprehensively the target measures while focusing on a concrete cross-cultural comparison between Taiwan and the {UK}. The results indicated that both measures show nonequivalence to different extents. The {PEVS} presents substantial problems of validity in Taiwan, whereas in the {UK} it is a meaningful unidimensional measure if one item is excluded. Difficulties with construct equivalence, translation, and method bias were identified as potential causes of the scale's nonequivalence. The {EAS} is a suitable measure within both cultures, but it is affected by the cumulative effect of differential item functioning ({DIF}) that makes the comparison of group means imprecise. Taiwanese respondents' salient tendency to endorse higher response categories than expected for their latent levels of {EA} was determined as a potential cause of {DIF}, which may be related to bias induced by the response categories' labels. Above all, this study reminds the importance of examining carefully the measurements employed in cross-cultural research to avoid reporting findings that could be potentially misleading.},

However, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to the principal trends and patterns that have occurred over the past quarter-century or the factors behind these changes. This systematic review considers previous empirical research that has addressed the temporal aspects to public perceptions. We address findings that have been obtained since the 1980s and using a range of methodologies. In this review, we consider early, seminal work examining public perceptions; survey studies carried out over long timescales and at an international scale; detailed statistical analyses of the drivers of changing perceptions; and qualitative research featuring a longitudinal component. Studies point to growing skepticism in the latter 2000s in some developed countries, underpinned by economic and sociopolitical factors. Even so, in many parts of the world, there has been growing concern about climate change in recent years. We conclude that the imbalance in the literature toward polling data, and toward studies of public perceptions in Western nations (particularly the United States), leaves much unknown about the progression of public understanding of climate change worldwide. More research is required that uses inferential statistical procedures to understand the reasons behind trends in public perceptions. The application of qualitative longitudinal methodologies also offers the potential for better appreciation of the cultural contexts in which climate change perceptions are evolving. {WIREs} Clim Change 2015, 6:35–61. doi: 10.1002/wcc.321 This article is categorized under: Perceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change {\textgreater} Communication Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge {\textgreater} Knowledge and Practice},

This article starts from the assumption that the current process of globalization or denationalization leads to the formation of a new structural conflict in Western European countries, opposing those who benefit from this process against those who tend to lose in the course of the events. The structural opposition between globalization ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ is expected to constitute potentials for political mobilization within national political contexts, the mobilization of which is expected to give rise to two intimately related dynamics: the transformation of the basic structure of the national political space and the strategic repositioning of the political parties within the transforming space. The article presents several hypotheses with regard to these two dynamics and tests them empirically on the basis of new data concerning the supply side of electoral politics from six Western European countries (Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland). The results indicate that in all the countries, the new cleavage has become embedded into existing two-dimensional national political spaces, that the meaning of the original dimensions has been transformed, and that the configuration of the main parties has become triangular even in a country like France.},

How will individual experiences with these weather trends shape climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors? In this article, we review 73 papers that have studied the relationship between climate change experiences and public opinion. Overall, we find mixed evidence that weather shapes climate opinions. Although there is some support for a weak effect of local temperature and extreme weather events on climate opinion, the heterogeneity of independent variables, dependent variables, study populations, and research designs complicate systematic comparison. To advance research on this critical topic, we suggest that future studies pay careful attention to differences between self-reported and objective weather data, causal identification, and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in weather and climate data. Refining research designs and methods in future studies will help us understand the discrepancies in results, and allow better detection of effects, which have important practical implications for climate communication. As the global population increasingly experiences weather conditions outside the range of historical experience, researchers, communicators, and policymakers need to understand how these experiences shape-and are shaped by-public opinions and behaviors.},

Drawing on quantitative data, archival work, and elite interviews, we review empirical support for this model and find that the evidence for its claims is weak relative to the theory’s pervasive influence. We find, first, that the strongest collective action claims appear empirically unsubstantiated in many important climate politics cases. Second, collective action claims—whether in their strongest or in more nuanced versions—appear observationally equivalent to alternative theories focused on distributive conflict within countries. We argue that extant patterns of climate policy making can be explained without invoking free-riding. Governments implement climate policies regardless of what other countries do, and they do so whether a climate treaty dealing with free-riding has been in place or not. Without an empirically grounded model for global
climate policy making, institutional and political responses to climate change may ineffectively target the wrong policy-making dilemma. We urge scholars to redouble their efforts to analyze the empirical linkages between domestic and international factors shaping climate policy making in an effort to empirically ground theories of global climate politics. Such analysis is, in turn, the topic of this issue’s special section.},

We report estimates that support the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between carbon emissions per-capita and income inequality. This trade-off is not homogeneous across countries and depends upon the level of development measured by income per-capita. Using panel smooth transition regression, we find that this relationship is negative for countries with low to moderate income per-capita but becomes slightly positive after passing a threshold located around fifteen thousand 2011 {US} dollars. Moreover, the inequality elasticity of emissions per-capita is comparable in magnitude to its income elasticity. Therefore, both inequality and income levels are crucial to define policies to reduce carbon emissions. This implies a challenge to policymakers who pursue to reduce both income inequality and carbon emissions.},

Some countries have undertaken ambitious programs to stave off climate disaster, others have done little, and still others have passed policies that were later rolled back. In this book, Matto Mildenberger opens the “black box” of domestic climate politics, examining policy making trajectories in several countries and offering a theoretical explanation for national differences in the climate policy process.Mildenberger introduces the concept of double representation—when carbon polluters enjoy political representation on both the left (through industrial unions fearful of job loss) and the right (through industrial business associations fighting policy costs)—and argues that different climate policy approaches can be explained by the interaction of climate policy preferences and domestic institutions. He illustrates his theory with detailed histories of climate politics in Norway, the United States, and Australia, along with briefer discussions of policies in in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada. He shows that Norway systematically shielded politically connected industrial polluters from costs beginning with its pioneering carbon tax; the United States, after the failure of carbon reduction legislation, finally acted on climate reform through a series of Obama administration executive actions; and Australia's Labor and Green parties enacted an emissions trading scheme, which was subsequently repealed by a conservative Liberal party government. Ultimately, Mildenberger argues for the importance of political considerations in understanding the climate policymaking process and discusses possible future policy directions.},

The Presidency of Francois Hollande was less an anomaly than the definitive failure of attempts to reconcile the social base of the left with the so-called 'modernisation' of the French model. The project, based on the pursuit of neoliberal reforms, did not die with Hollande's failure; it was taken up and radicalised by his successor, Emmanuel Macron. This project needs a social base, the 'bourgeois bloc', designed to overcome the right/left divide by a new alliance between the middle and upper classes.

Estimating an ordinal group-level {IRT} model in each of four issue domains, we obtain biennial estimates of the absolute economic conservatism, relative economic conservatism, social conservatism, and immigration conservatism of men and women in three age categories in each country. Aggregating the group-level estimates yields estimates of the average conservatism in national publics in each biennium between 1981–82 and 2015–16. The four measures exhibit contrasting cross-sectional cleavages and distinct temporal dynamics, illustrating the multidimensionality of mass ideology in Europe. Subjecting our measures to a series of validation tests, we show that the constructs they measure are distinct and substantively important and that they perform as well as or better than one-dimensional proxies for mass conservatism (left–right self-placement and median voter scores).

We attempt to advance our understanding of political contestation in Europe by mapping the dimensionality of the political space across 24 countries using Chapel Hill expert survey ({CHES}) data. We test how well different models of the European political space fit the {CHES} data and find that three-dimensional models best fit the data in all countries. However, there is considerable cross-national variation in how the three dimensions relate to one another. Given this, we present a new measure of dimensional complexity that captures the degree to which these three dimensions are related. In so doing, we improve our understanding of the complexity of the political space in European countries.},

I hypothesize: (1) that people have a variety of needs which are given high or low priority according to their degree of fulfillment: people act on behalf of their most important unsatisfied need, giving relatively little attention to needs already satisfied—except that (2) people tend to retain the value priorities adopted in their formative years throughout adult life. In contemporary Western Europe, needs for physical safety and economic security are relatively well satisfied for an unprecedentedly large share of the population. Younger, more affluent groups have been formed entirely under these conditions, and seem relatively likely to give top priority to fulfillment of needs which remain secondary to the older and less affluent majority of the population. Needs for belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment (characterized as “post-bourgeois” values) may take top priorities among the former group. Survey data from six countries indicate that the value priorities of the more affluent postwar group do contrast with those of groups raised under conditions of lesser economic and physical security. National patterns of value priorities correspond to the given nation's economic history, moreover, suggesting that the age-group differences reflect the persistence of preadult experiences, rather than life cycle effects. The distinctive value priorities imply distinctive political behavior—being empirically linked with preferences for specific political issues and political parties in a predictable fashion. If the respective age cohorts retain their present value priorities, we would expect long-term shifts in the political goals and patterns of political partisanship prevailing in these societies.},

Insecurity has the opposite effect, stimulating an Authoritarian Reflex in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms. The 35 years of exceptional security experienced by developed democracies after {WWII} brought pervasive cultural changes, including the rise of Green parties and the spread of democracy. During the past 35 years, economic growth continued, but virtually all of the gains went to those at the top; the less-educated experienced declining existential security, fueling support for Populist Authoritarian phenomena such as Brexit, France’s National Front and Trump’s takeover of the Republican party. This raises two questions: (1) “What motivates people to support Populist Authoritarian movements?” And (2) “Why is the populist authoritarian vote so much higher now than it was several decades ago in high-income countries?” The two questions have different answers. Support for populist authoritarian parties is motivated by a backlash against cultural change. From the start, younger Postmaterialist birth cohorts supported environmentalist parties, while older, less secure cohorts supported authoritarian xenophobic parties, in an enduring intergenerational value clash. But for the past three decades, strong period effects have been working to increase support for xenophobic parties: economic gains have gone almost entirely to those at the top, while a large share of the population experienced declining real income and job security, along with a large influx of immigrants and refugees. Cultural backlash explains why given individuals support Populist Authoritarian movements. Declining existential security explains why support for these movements is greater now than it was thirty years ago.},

It is argued that, on the one hand, there is much to suggest that current crises cannot be resolved under existing institutional frameworks and that degrowth is a political project that provides solutions to some of the key problems currently facing humanity. On the other hand, the prospects for a degrowth paradigm shift remain bleak: unlike political projects that became hegemonic in the past, degrowth has neither support from a comprehensive coalition of social forces nor any consent to its agenda among the broader population.},

This concept positions itself in a quest to change the grammar of environmental politics by embedding it in the lived materiality of everyday life, but differs from prefigurative movement-oriented strategies by prioritising the integration of majority populations and by acknowledging the role of political rule-setting, i.e. coercion. Building on a multi-level integral state project, eco-social politics resides in particular strategies, procedures, and institutions to collectively (re)negotiate common sense, with the aim to partially and pragmatically suture social relations to find transformative answers to contemporary eco-social crises. Here, I explore potentials for stronger dialectical links between deliberative and representative democratic institutions.},

That is the question this book addresses. Adhering to the multiplicity of degrowth whilst also arguing that strategic prioritisation and coordination are key, Degrowth \& Strategy advances the debate on strategy for social-ecological transformation. It explores what strategising means, identifies key directions for the degrowth movement, and scrutinises strategies in practice that aim to realise a degrowth society.
Bringing together voices from degrowth and related movements, this book creates a polyphony for change going beyond the sum of its parts.

Based on Buch-Hansen's assessment of the (not yet actualised) prerequisites for a degrowth paradigm shift, discursive practices are analysed against the aim of building a comprehensive coalition of social forces and achieving broad-based consent. In addition, the paper draws on Gramscian theory to introduce a third unactualised prerequisite: the will to coerce and rule.

As such, it will take a class struggle to solve. In this ground breaking class analysis, Matthew T. Huber argues that the carbon-intensive capitalist class must be confronted for producing climate change.  Yet, the narrow and unpopular roots of climate politics in the professional class is not capable of building a movement up to this challenge. For an alternative strategy, he proposes climate politics that appeals to the vast majority of society: the working class. Huber evaluates the Green New Deal as a first attempt to channel working class material and ecological interests and advocates building union power in the very energy system we need to dramatically transform. In the end, as in classical socialist movements of the early 20th Century, winning the climate struggle will need to be internationalist based on a form of planetary working class solidarity.},

Attuned to the links between the exploitation of labor and the exploitation of the environment, ecosocialism stands against both reformist “market ecology” and “productivist socialism.” By embracing a new model of robustly democratic planning, society can take control of the means of production and its own destiny. Shorter work hours and a focus on authentic needs over consumerism can facilitate the elevation of “being” over “having” and the achievement of a deeper sense of freedom for all. To realize this vision, however, environmentalists and socialists will need to recognize their common struggle and how that connects with the broader “movement of movements.”},

For these purposes, we consider three socio-economic groups: the educated bourgeoisie ({BE}), the working class ({CP}), and the financial elite ({EF}). Specifically, we elaborate an original perspective on social groups’ preferences regarding environmental protection and capital-financed redistribution. Under the disjoint majority vote, this model delivers full capital protection, no redistribution, and no environmental policies. This is the best solution for the {EF} group. Consequently, a two-party coalition can be formed that improves the welfare of the {BE} and {CP} groups. Moreover, the coalitions’ equilibria deliver redistributive and environmental policies entailing higher incentives for the ecological transition and lower ex-post inequalities. Finally, in line with the rise of green finance, we investigate the surge of new alliances and highlight the risks of unequal ecological outcomes.},

Economic systems, including patterns of consumption and production, play a key role in sustainability transformations. The notion that capitalist systems are at the root of current ecological and social crises has led to the emergence of different alternative economic discourses, that seek to address the indirect drivers of unsustainability. In this article, we aim to contribute to moving the debate beyond critiques of capitalism by focussing on the paths of transformation towards alternatives. To this end, we analyse several alternative economic discourses in order to show the breadth of the debate, and to better understand the roles and strategies of various discourses in societal transformation. Seven discourses are included, of which Buen Vivir, Degrowth and Wellbeing Economy are analysed in-depth. This is done through a systematic analysis of literature published between 2015 and 2022, using an enhanced conceptual framework based on the works of Wright (2019) and Chertkovskaya (2022). Our analysis suggests that the discourses represent different modes of transformation, and that these differences exist both between, as well as within the different discourses. We argue that transformations cannot be achieved through single discourses, or modes of transformation. Rather, concerted efforts of different discourses aimed at addressing indirect drivers of unsustainability can provide the multi-faceted processes of societal change, in which they can support and reinforce one another through alliances and mutual learning.},

	abstract = {This article explores the relationship between degrowth and the theory of Capital as Power ({CasP}), aiming to understand how socio-ecological transformations can unfold against capitalist power dynamics. While degrowth scholars have largely overlooked this perspective on capital, {CasP} argues that capitalism is primarily a mode of power, with capitalisation quantifying power – the confidence in – the ability to shape society against opposition. Key {CasP} concepts are brought into dialogue with degrowth research to identify potential implications and offer a step towards a theory of change for degrowth. The article first outlines the {CasP} perspective, including its notion of power, the process of capitalisation and the conflictual nature of capital accumulation, and highlights links with degrowth research. It then looks at the elements underlying the valuation of capital as power and how they provide entry points for degrowth transformations. The role of dominant capital groups and the concept of “sabotage” in exercising power over society are then addressed. As such, degrowth transformations must challenge the confidence of dominant capital groups in their ability to rule, as these groups inhibit possibilities for socio-ecological change. This dynamic, summarised in a conceptual diagram, provides a first step towards a theory of change for degrowth in the face of capital accumulation. Finally, the conclusion offers potential directions for further research.},

	abstract = {For over 50 years, scientists have sounded alarms that the burning of fossil fuels is causing changes to the Earth's climate, and that failure to take action on climate change will have devastating consequences. Despite this urgency, {CO}2 emissions (and global temperatures) continue to climb. Progress on mitigating climate change is slowed by the stubborn persistence of climate skepticism, as well as a failure for nonskeptics to translate their concern about climate change into meaningful action. The goal of this article is to describe and synthesize research on how to understand (and reduce) this public inaction on climate change. In the first half of the article, we examine the question of how to understand (and overcome) climate change skepticism. We review international evidence regarding the role of demographics, ideologies, and conspiracist worldviews in shaping people's willingness to believe in the reality of human-caused climate change. We then review theory and research on how to successfully capture the attention of—and change the behavior of—people who traditionally resist climate change messages, such as those high in conservatism and free-market beliefs. In the second half of the article, we examine how to promote more climate-friendly behaviors among people who believe in the reality of climate change. Evidence will be reviewed suggesting that many people agree that climate change is caused by humans, but are not yet willing to make the necessary investments and sacrifices to respond to this threat. We then draw on relevant literatures to critically discuss three strategies for promoting proenvironmental behavior: (i) optimistic versus pessimistic messages; (ii) in-group versus out-group messenger effects; and (c) the use of descriptive and injunctive norms.},

While two thirds of the inequality in individual emissions was due to inequalities between countries in 1990, the situation has entirely reversed: in 2019, 63\% of the global inequality in individual emissions was due to gaps between low and high emitters within countries. Emissions from investments, rather than from consumption, represent the bulk of emissions of the rich: around 70\% of global top 1\% emissions come from their investments.

Here I estimate the global inequality of individual greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions between 1990 and 2019 using a newly assembled dataset of income and wealth inequality, environmental input-output tables and a framework differentiating emissions from consumption and investments. In my benchmark estimates, I find that the bottom 50\% of the world population emitted 12\% of global emissions in 2019, whereas the top 10\% emitted 48\% of the total. Since 1990, the bottom 50\% of the world population has been responsible for only 16\% of all emissions growth, whereas the top 1\% has been responsible for 23\% of the total. While per-capita emissions of the global top 1\% increased since 1990, emissions from low- and middle-income groups within rich countries declined. Contrary to the situation in 1990, 63\% of the global inequality in individual emissions is now due to a gap between low and high emitters within countries rather than between countries. Finally, the bulk of total emissions from the global top 1\% of the world population comes from their investments rather than from their consumption. These findings have implications for contemporary debates on fair climate policies and stress the need for governments to develop better data on individual emissions to monitor progress towards sustainable lifestyles.},

We analyze how occupational structure, either through the economic costs individuals may incur when such policies are implemented or through value preferences shaped by the workplace, influence support for these policies. Drawing on data from Round 8 of the European Social Survey ({ESS}8) and 2 alternative class-structure classifications, our findings reveal 3 key insights. First, on the vertical dimension, we find that costlier measures face stronger resistance from lower socioeconomic groups. Second, on the horizontal dimension, sociocultural professionals emerge as the social class most supportive of environmental policies, while manual workers are the most reluctant to accept them. Finally, our results indicate that the interaction between social structure and the territorial dimension is weak. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the social cleavages that may influence the ecological transition.},

This paper argues that the origins of the growth model approach can be found in contributions made by Michel Freyssenet in the framework of Gerpisa in the 1990s/2000. By presenting the contributions and limitations of Freyssenet’s approach, it is possible to establish how contemporary growth model approaches fail to establish a solid link between political economy and heterodox macroeconomics. It appears that an approach that starts from the differentiation of interests of social groups and considers the autonomy of politics has more potential to achieve this task, allowing to recover the inspiration of Kalecki’s 1943 article on the political limits to economic policy.},

Their members are first and foremost firms and employer associations, but fractions of labor are also included, if their interests do not impair the model's functionality. There is no guarantee that a growth coalition and a winning electoral coalition coincide. In normal times, a growth coalition effectively insulates itself from political competition, and mainstream political parties converge on key growth model policies. In moments of crisis, however, the coalition shrinks, favoring the emergence of challengers that fundamentally contest the status quo. The way governing parties respond to electoral pressures can also play an important role in the recalibration of growth models. The authors illustrate the argument by examining the politics of 'export-led growth' in Germany, 'construction-led growth' in Spain, and 'balanced growth' in Sweden.},

Using data from an own survey, we identify habitus types and place these in the space of social positions. We apply principal component analysis to a large set of questions about social, ecological, and climate change related topics and identify eight underlying eco–social dispositions. These are used for cluster analyses that find typical constellations of eco–social dispositions within the Swedish population: variants of eco–social habitus. We find seven habitus types and describe their social characteristics, political preferences, and practices. Finally, the seven habitus are plotted onto the map of social positions, the Bourdieusian social space, highlighting their relations—proximities, tensions, and contestations—to each other. We find evidence that political struggles around social–ecological transformations reproduce existing social structures but are also connected to new “eco–social” divisions that appear between groups in similar positions. In the conclusion we discuss the implications for social–ecological transformations based on sustainable welfare.},

Stressing the differences between our concept and Gramsci’s historical bloc, we discuss how different notions of domination and crisis are related with our own concept and we conclude by looking at what a historical bloc would be in our own approach.},

Recent literature underlines the link between public and private actors and shows that the second industrial revolution in Switzerland owed its success to state-led organized capitalism. If the majority of studies analysed in detail one or more components of the Swiss organized capitalism, to our knowledge, there are no works seeking to explain the (institutional) construction of this organized capitalism by mobilizing a large number of factors in a single theoretical frame of reference. Using the Regulation Theory approach, this article sheds light on the institutional construction of the Swiss organized capitalism. We show that it rested on original institutional arrangements driven by the necessity to survive on external markets. We therefore demonstrate that these arrangements also enabled Switzerland to successfully deal with the production of essential public goods supporting both industrialization and national social bonds required to promote political unity.},

To gain clarity about the institutional changes necessary to limit the scale of economic activity, it is essential that ecological economics understands the limitations of its neoclassical roots and expands its theoretical framework to include how markets are embedded in social and institutional structures.

However less progress has been made in understanding the internal dynamics of the economy that produce periods of slow growth, even in the absence of biophysical constraints. The real economy is a complex system, replete with myriad positive feedback loops. By looking at the economy from a systems perspective ecological economists can better understand the internal dynamics of a market system that lead to the periodic depressions and recessions that characterize “the failed growth economy.” A non-growing or declining economy exacerbates formidable economic problems such as unemployment, debt, and poverty. Since the middle of the 20th century governments have pursued growth strategies to solve social problems. But the age of economic growth is coming to an end, driven by its own internal dynamics and by biophysical forces such as climate change and peak oil. Degrowth implies less, and the steady state implies less on a permanent basis. Ecological economists need to pay more attention to the implications of less for a market economy and the effects upon people under our present economic configuration.},

We identify challenges in the conceptualization of coevolutionary relationships in relation to: the interaction between different hierarchical levels of evolution; the role of space and social power; uneven rates of change and crises.

We find profound complementarities between factors influencing aggregate demand and drivers of technological change that affect both “short-run” fluctuations and long-term growth patterns. From a normative point of view, simulations show a corresponding complementarity between “Keynesian” and “Schumpeterian” policies in sustaining long-run growth paths characterized by milder fluctuations and relatively lower unemployment levels. The matching or mismatching between innovative exploration of new technologies and the conditions of demand generation appear to suggest the presence of two distinct “regimes” of growth (or absence thereof) characterized by different short-run fluctuations and unemployment levels.},

It questions: how are conflicting interests shaped and taken into account in policy making? How should they be accounted for? What motivates the behaviour of firms and individuals, and how is it possible to change these motivations to produce the favoured common outcomes?The author addresses these questions by integrating elements from classical institutional economics, neoclassical economics, sociology and ecological economics. He argues that public policy in general, and environmental policy in particular, are best examined from an institutional perspective. In this way the author presents a distinct and consistent alternative to standard neoclassical economics for students and scholars who are interested in an institutional understanding of environmental policy making. The book is written in a clear and accessible style with boxes and figures to help explain the issues and, as such, would be an ideal alternative or supplement to the standard environmental economics texts.},

They are seen as rules concerning a) who should participate and in which capacity, b) what is considered data and which form data should take, and c) rules about how a conclusion is reached. Specifically, the choice of method defines the logic of the appraisal process and next influences the output. While cost benefit analysis is based on the assumption of individual rationality, deliberative methods assume that individuals can act according to social rationality. The first part of the paper is devoted to clarifying what institutions are and their role in the valuation process. Second, the main features of environmental or ecosystem services and the demands they raise for decision-making are described. A general framework for evaluating appraisal methods is then developed. Finally, this structure is elaborated in more detail as a basis for deciding over the choices of methods in the case of evaluating ecosystem services. A set of unresolved issues are identified — especially related to how the choice of appraisal methods themselves should be instituted.},

To further develop our ability to deliver, I propose that we expand our analyses by a) drawing more on institutional theory and b) include also political processes in our research. The present political-economic system is unable to ensure sustainable futures. The paper argues that the root of the problem lies in its institutional structures. I illustrate possible changes to these that could take societies onto a sustainable development path. Focus here is on creating institutions able to strengthen the role of the future in decision-making. Here I focus on both political and economic institutions, illustrating how a change in these could ensure sustainability. I also discuss changes in environmental regulation strategies. The analyses of different options are used to illustrate what kind of studies are needed to advance sustainability. They form the basis for specifying directions that ecological economics could take to further support a necessary societal transformation process.},

Son analyse concrète, à la fois historique et théorique, de la crise des années 1970 comme la crise du mode de régulation fordiste des économies occidentales - où la consommation salariale est le moteur de la croissance - fait autorité. Reprenant le flambeau de la critique de l'économie de marché, il a inspiré tout un courant qui représente la seule alternative nouvelle à la " pensée unique ". Contre les libéraux, les régulationnistes considèrent en effet que le marché n'est pas un mode de régulation suffisant de nos économies. Les institutions sociales, notamment la monnaie, ont aussi leur rôle à jouer. Ce livre paraît aujourd'hui dans une édition revue et corrigée, augmentée d'une postface inédite dans laquelle Michel Aglietta esquisse les issues possibles de cette crise qui n'en finit pas de finir.},

The article suggests that environmental governance is best understood as the establishment, reaffirmation or change of institutions to resolve conflicts over environmental resources. It also explains why the choice of these institutions is a matter of social justice rather than of efficiency. The article suggests a way to understand formal and state-centered governance solutions as forms of collective ownership not unlike common property. The article demonstrates how institutional analysis can gain resolution by looking at the functional and structural tiers, organization of governance functions, and formulation of key institutional rules as key aspects of the design of governance institutions.},

These four criteria are constitutive of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which has become the dominant rhetorical device of environmental governance. We discuss the tendency for disciplinary research to focus on particular subsets of the four criteria, and argue that such a practice promotes solutions that do not acknowledge the dynamics of scale and the heterogeneity of institutional contexts. We advocate an interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of environmental decisionmaking that seeks to identify legitimate and context-sensitive institutional solutions producing equitable, efficient, and effective outcomes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by using it to examine decisions concerning contested nature conservation and multiple-use commons in the management of Hickling Broad in Norfolk in the United Kingdom. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches enable the generalisation and transfer of lessons in a way that respects the specifics and context of the issue at hand.},

The paper identifies the conceptualisation of environmental problems as instances of interdependence and the acknowledgement of positive transaction costs as the hallmarks of new institutional approach to the environment. The paper also discusses how the new institutional approach can be extended so as to acknowledge plural motivations and limited cognitive capacity. The paper investigates how evolutionary and collective action theories frame the choice and change of environmental governance institutions and discusses how the notion of social capital can enrich institutional analyses.

	abstract = {Recent contributions in comparative political economy have made much of the 'growth model perspective', presenting it as a way to 'rethink political economy'. This paper argues that the origins of the growth model approach can be found in contributions by Michel Freyssenet made in the framework of {GERPISA} (Groupe d'étude et de recherche permanent sur l'industrie et les salariés de l'automobile) in the 1990s/2000. By presenting the contributions and limitations of Freyssenet's approach, it is possible to establish how contemporary growth model approaches fail to establish a solid link between political economy and heterodox macroeconomics. It appears that an approach that starts from the differentiation of interests of social groups and takes into account the autonomy of politics has more potential to achieve this task, allowing to recover the inspiration of Kalecki's 1943 article on the political limits to economic policy.},

By contrast, climate policy has broad public support but concentrated opposition in communities where costs are imposed. This spatial distribution of weak supporters and strong local opponents mirrors opposition to other policies with diffuse public benefits and concentrated local costs. I use a natural experiment to investigate whether citizens living in proximity to wind energy projects retrospectively punished an incumbent government because of its climate policy. Using both fixed effects and instrumental variable estimators, I identify electoral losses for the incumbent party ranging from 4 to 10\%, with the effect persisting 3 km from wind turbines. There is also evidence that voters are informed, only punishing the government responsible for the policy. I conclude that the spatial distribution of citizens' policy preferences can affect democratic accountability through ‘spatially distorted signalling’, which can exacerbate political barriers to addressing climate change.},

Populist right forces emerge as the primary beneficiaries of the backlash as they tend to be more sceptical regarding anthropogenic climate change and less supportive of climate policies. In turn, their electoral success has negative implications for countries’ climate policymaking and performance.

	abstract = {On entend par politique agricole l'ensemble des mesures relatives à l'organisation économique, sociale et juridique de l'agriculture, prises par la Confédération, les cantons, les corporations de droit public, les organisations professionnelles (Paysannerie) et politiques. Les domaines qu'elle touche vont de la recherche et de la formation à la politique des prix et des marchés, en passant par les améliorations foncières, les constructions agricoles, le droit foncier et la politique commerciale et douanière. Ses principaux moyens d'action sont les aides financières (subventions, paiements directs), les taxes douanières, les prix garantis, la prise en charge et le contingentement de la production. Ses grands axes sont définis par la Confédération qui, dès le {XXe} s., œuvra d'entente avec les fédérations agricoles. Souvent cependant, la ligne adoptée heurta non seulement les intérêts de l'industrie, du commerce et des consommateurs, mais suscita aussi une opposition dans les milieux paysans eux-mêmes.},

	abstract = {This text aims to explain a paradox: the modest contribution of Regulation Theory to the debates on the Capitalocene. After explaining the changing role of the "environment" in regulationist analyses for nearly 50 years, we argue that they mostly adopt an apolitical definition / perspective of the environment and lack a critical and reflexive approach. In brief, the regulationist framework needs a truly political ecology.},

	shorttitle = {The accumulation–metabolism nexus},
	abstract = {We investigate the links between accumulation and socio-metabolic regimes by studying French capitalism from socio-economic and material perspectives since 1948. We characterize its social metabolism both in domestic and footprint approaches. The periodization of accumulation regimes in terms of Fordism and finance-led capitalism translates into material terms. The offshore materiality of finance-led capitalism partly substitutes for and partly complements the more domestic materiality inherited from Fordism. The transition phase between the two socio-metabolic regimes clearly corresponds to the emergence of the offshoring–financialization nexus of French capitalism, indicating the shift from Fordism to finance-led capitalism. We highlight strong inter-linkages between accumulation and material dynamics and discuss how materials may be instrumental in shaping accumulation regimes. We therefore introduce the concept of accumulation–metabolism nexus. This work illustrates the relevance of combining institutionalist macroeconomics with Material Flow Analysis.},
