        SamplingDescription: Random sample stratified by cantons of 10'395 Swiss citizens
          with the right to vote, aged 18 and above (no upper age limit) and living
          in private households in Switzerland. Small cantons were oversampled in
          order to achieve a minimum number of 50 respondents in each canton. Furthermore,
          the cantons of Geneva and Ticino were oversampled, too, thanks to additional
          funding from these cantons. The sample is based on the sampling register
          of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).
        SamplingMethod: Random sampling
        Universe: Swiss citizens aged 18 years or older living in Switzerland
        WeightingInformation: 'Different weighting variables are provided in the dataset:

          - Design weight ("weight_d") to correct the oversampling of some of the
          cantons.

          - Turnout weight ("weight_d_t") to correct the overrepresentation of voters
          in the sample, according to the official election results. (This weight
          already includes the design weight.)

          - Party choice weight ("weight_d_p") to correct the distribution of party
          voters in the sample, according to the official election results. (This
          weight already includes the design weight.)

          - Total weight ("weight_tot") to correct for the biases induced by the oversampling
          of some of the cantons, the overrepresentation of voters and the distribution
          of party voters in the sample. This combined weight is equal to the multiplication
          of the design weight x turnout weight (without design weight) x party choice
          weight (without design weight).


          For the cantons of Zurich, Geneva and Ticino, there are also turnout, party
          choice and total weights provided in the dataset. The party weights ("weight_p_zh",
          "weight_p_ge", and "weight_p_ti") are to be used with the three cantonal
          vote choice variables (i.e., "f11800ZH", "f11800GE", and "f11800TI", respectively).'

          (32.6 minutes) to complete the web questionnaire were removed from the data
          (speeders). Furthermore, only respondents whose age and sex corresponded
          to the information from the sampling frame were retained.

        QuestionVariableLink: The variable names in the dataset generally correspond

          straightforward to see from the data documentation which variable is based
          on which questionnaire question (e.g., f11800rec in the dataset is the combination
          of variables f11800, f11800s and f11800s2 in the web questionnaire). Variables
          that required recoding of open-ended responses generally end with the letters
          “rec” (e.g., f12700rec).

  abstract:
    en: "The Swiss Election Study (Selects) 2023 consists of four complementary components:\
      \ The Post-Election Survey (PES), the Panel Survey, the Candidate Survey, and\
      \ the Media Analysis. The study design is largely inspired by Selects 2019.\
      \ The PES and Candidate Survey are mixed-mode surveys (online/paper), with a\
      \ push-to-web design, whereas the Panel Study is an online survey. In April\
      \ 2022, a call for questions/modules was opened to allow researchers from Switzerland\
      \ and abroad to include novel questions into one or different components of\
      \ Selects. Ten out of 14 submitted proposals were selected by the Selects Commission\
      \ after a review process conducted by internationally renowned election researchers,\
      \ and were fully or partially integrated into one or several components of Selects\
      \ 2023. The Selects surveys were approved by the Ethics commission of the University\
      \ of Lausanne.\n\nPost-Election Survey (PES):\nThe Post-Election Survey consists\
      \ of 5033 respondents who answered the questionnaire in the period from 23 October\
      \ 2023 to 12 January 2024. The survey was conducted in a sequential mixed mode\
      \ with web offered as the first option: 90% responded in this way, while 10%\
      \ responded by returning the paper questionnaire that was sent out with the\
      \ second reminder to those that had not completed the web questionnaire. The\
      \ sampling was based on a representative sample of around 2’600 Swiss citizens,\
      \ with an oversampling of small cantons to have at least 50 respondents in every\
      \ canton. An additional oversampling was done in the cantons of Geneva and Ticino\
      \ thanks to additional funding from these cantons. The sample was drawn by the\
      \ Federal Statistics Office from the SRPH. Sample members received an unconditional\
      \ incentive (10 CHF in cash) that was sent out with the invitation letter. Module\
      \ 6 Questionnaire of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems was included\
      \ into the PES.\n\nPanel Survey:\nThe Panel Survey studies the evolution of\
      \ opinion and vote intention/choice during the different phases of the election\
      \ cycle. In 2023, three waves were conducted: the first before the main campaign\
      \ period (June/early August), the second during the election campaign (September/October),\
      \ and the third after the elections (October/November). The initial random sample\
      \ (stratified by big region/NUTS II) was taken by the Federal Statistics Office\
      \ from the SRPH. 8197 individuals responded to the first wave, 6077 to the second\
      \ wave, and 5579 to the third wave. Conditional incentives were used in all\
      \ three panel waves (lottery of 5x300 CHF in wave 1, 10 CHF in cash in waves\
      \ 2 and 3). This three-wave panel will be continued with annual follow-up waves\
      \ until the 2027 elections. \n\nCandidate Survey:\nThe Candidate Survey was\
      \ carried out among all candidates for the National Council and the Council\
      \ of States in the framework of the international Comparative Candidate Survey\
      \ (CCS) project, based on the Round III questionnaire. The survey collects data\
      \ on the biography, campaign activities, and policy position of the candidates.\
      \ Among others, the information gathered makes possible the study of underlying\
      \ factors of candidates’ electoral success, as well as of issues of representation\
      \ and linkage between voters and elites. In 2023, 2527 out of 5997 candidates\
      \ participated in the Candidate Survey. This survey was conducted by FORS in\
      \ collaboration with Politools and the University of Bern. \n\nMedia Analysis:\n\
      On behalf of Selects, the Center for Research & Methods at the University of\
      \ Applied Sciences in Business Administration Zurich (HWZ) conducted a Media\
      \ Analysis. The Media Analysis is a supplement to the Panel Survey and makes\
      \ it possible to analyse the election campaign in the media and its influence\
      \ on voters' opinion formation. A media study has been part of Selects since\
      \ 2003. In 2023, 116 daily or weekly newspapers (print and online) were content-analyzed\
      \ in the period between 1 May 2023 and 31 October 2023."

      otherComments: 'In the PES, we used an unconditional cash incentive (10 CHF)
        that was sent to sample members together with the invitation letter.

        Panel: in wave 1, respondents participated in a lottery (5x300 CHF); in waves
        2 and 3, respondents received a conditional cash incentive (10 CHF) after
        completion of the survey.'
      participantSelection: 'PES: stratified by canton, e.g. individuals were randomly
        selected within the 26 cantons. A basic sample of around 2600 individuals
        was calculated for each canton to minimize variance regarding participation
        and party choice. In the least populous cantons, the samples were increased
        to ensure that at least 50 individuals could be surveyed. An oversample was
        taken for the cantons of Ticino and Geneva.

        Panel: stratified by big region (NUTS 2), e.g. individuals were randomly selected
        within the seven major regions (Lake Geneva Region, Espace Mittelland, North-West
        Switzerland, Zurich region, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, Ticino).

        The samples were drawn from the SRPH by the Federal Statistics Office.'

      otherComments: The issues of the newspaper articles were coded based on the
        same categories as the most important problems perceived by voters in the
        PES and the Panel, as well as by candidates included in the Candidate Survey.
      participantSelection: Newspapers were mainly accessed on Swissdox@Liri. Only
        articles dealing with Swiss politics were selected.
      population: 116 daily and weekly newspapers (print and online) were semi-automatically
