In this post, I will try to construct longer series of the Swiss labour income share.\n\nBut first, let's ask why official data do not go back further than 1991 for Switzerland. There are, in my opinion, two possible explanations. The first explanation could be that the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) revised the Swiss system of national accounts in the 1990s. Swiss national accounts data before the 1990s are thus based on an ancient system, and mixing these data with the new system does not guarantee methodological coherence. However, this does not explain why the FSO still publishes long-run data mixing the ancient and new systems, as it does with [GDP](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases.assetdetail.27065074.html). Another explanation could be about the different measures of the wage share. The wage share data provided by AMECO is the *adjusted wage share*, which is different from the most basic measure of the wage share: the *unadjusted wage share*, which is:\n\n$$Unadjusted \\:wage\\:share = \\frac{Compensation \\: of \\: employees}{GDP}$$\n\nAccording the 2008 System of National Accounts (cite p.139), compensation of employees is the sum of two components:\n\n    1. Wages and salaries\n    2. Social insurance contributions payed by employers\n\n\nOne major issue with the unadjusted wage share is that it does not take into account the income received by self-employed. This measure is downwards-biased because part of the income of the self-employed belongs to labour income. This measure is hence only a lower-bound of the wage share and underestimates the latter. As a result, different methods have been developped to adjust the labour income share. In the Swiss case, however, the unadjuster LIS has the advantage to be calculated using long-term series by combining data of the old and new systems of national accounts offered by the FSO. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
