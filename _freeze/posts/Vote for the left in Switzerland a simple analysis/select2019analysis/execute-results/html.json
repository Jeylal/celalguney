The publication of this book and of its [online database](https://wpid.world/resources/) got me very interested in the study of political cleavages from a political economy approach. This book contains huge amount of findings and observations, but there is one which is really emphasized by the authors: from roughly the 1980s until, the class-based political divide has become a multidimensional one incorporating a \"educational\" or, in Inglehart terms, a \"postmaterial\" or \"cultural\" cleavage [@gethin_political_2021] [@inglehart_silent_1971]. Very shortly, They found that the electoral support for the left shifted from the low income and low education classes to the highly educated ones. Regarding the electoral support for the right, the latter remains positively correlated with income.\n\nThis post is going to simply test this finding for Switzerland using the post-electoral survey for the National Council election in 2015. The following analysis is based on data analysis of the Swiss Election Study (Selects) of 2019. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/13846/18585/overview). I will test if the support for the left is linked positively with the education level and negatively with income.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nTo analyze the link between vote for the left (dependent variable) and income and education, I create a dummy variable from the variable \"f10300\" which asked for which party the respondent voted in the 2015 election. From this variable, I create a dummy variable taking value one if the respondant voted for either the socialist party (PS), the green (PES), solidarité or Swiss labor party (PST-POP). Note that those choices can be controversial and a matter of debate because I don't include the Social-christian party and I include the greens. This is a matter of debate if those parties can be classified as left or not, but I will not go further about this.\n\nRegarding the independ variables, the variable \"f28910\" asks the gross monthly houshold income of the individual and the variable has 15 income brackets (we thus do not have directly the income of the respondant). For education, \"f21310\" asks the highest level of achieved education. Here is below descriptive statistics for these variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Education level](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gross monthly houshold income](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![](http://127.0.0.1:40085/chunk_output/E2665063b75fc19f/65970EB7/ckve2j4e42tvi/000010.png)\n\nSome observations can already be made with the descriptive statistics. First, the left gathered relatively few vote with only about 26% of voters. This attests the weakness of left-wing parties in Switzerland. Second, about 30% of the individuals in the sample did vocational training and this is rather coherent since in Switzerland most people follows vocational training and apprenticeship. Third, there is a weird \"peak\" in the income graph. Indeed, about 7.5% declared having an income superior than 15'000, which seems rather bizarre at least to me and I still have no explanation for this.\n\n## First model: binary logistic regression\n\nLet's first start with a logistic regression. I simply regress the vote for the left with income and education. I leave education and income coded as numerical variables for now, since they have enough categories this is not big problem. Of course, that would have been better if I had directly the income of each individual and not brackets. Moreover, I could still do a Pareto interpolation, but I can't due to lack of information: I don't have the average income (total and per bracket) of the sample.\n\nThe model is thus:\n\n$$\nLog(\\frac{P(left)}{1 - P(left)}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1income_i + \\beta_2educ_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$\n\nNote that this is a very first step, I will step by step complexify this model.\n\nHere is the regression table:\n\n\n\n<table style=\"text-align:center\"><caption><strong>Model 1: binary logit regression (odd ratios)</strong></caption>\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td><em>Dependent variable:</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td colspan=\"1\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black\"></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td>vote.left</td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gross.monthly.hh.income</td><td>0.953<sup>***</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td>(0.007)</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Education.level</td><td>1.114<sup>***</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td>(0.008)</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Constant</td><td>0.199<sup>**</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td>(0.078)</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\"></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Observations</td><td>7,594</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Log Likelihood</td><td>-4,311.174</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Akaike Inf.

The coefficients are statistically significant at the one percent level, which is not a surprise because the sample is rather large with 7'594 observations. Inference will become more of a problem when I consider education or even income as a factor/qualitative variable (income here is coded in brackets, so it is rather an ordinal variable, and there is to my knowledge to way to solve this problem).\n\nOdd ratios are known to be rather difficult to interpret. In effect, odd ratios are not what the literature calls \"quantity of interest\", that is to say, the quantity of the dependent variable which is the most easy to interpret. I this model, the quantity of interest is the probability to vote for a left wing party and not the odds. A lot of economists and social scientists prefer to have a look directly at the marginal effects and predicted probability to have a better view of the relationships between the variables and of the quantity of interest.\n\nI first plot simple graphs of the estimated curves:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Probability of voting for the left - curves from estimated coefficients](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the slope of the education level curve is steeper than the one for income: this means that the positive link between the level of education and the probability to vote for the left is greater than the negative with income. But let's have a look directly at the marginal effects.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to compute marginal effects, which make the latter sometimes confusing because we don't know which type of marginal effects are represented. I will here consider one type of marginal effects:\n\n-   Group-average marginal effects: slope estimates are produced for each row of the dataset used in computing the model. Then, the estimates can be grouped by the values of one of the regressor and the average for each group is computed.\n\nA first step in group-average marginal effects in R is to use the function \"slopes\" which calculate estimates of the slopes (marginal effects) for each observation used to compute the model in the first place. The term \"variables\" is for the variable for which the slopes are estimated and \"by\" the argument for\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmarginaleffectseduc <- slopes(reg, variables = \"Education.level\")\nhead(marginaleffectseduc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n            Term Estimate Std.

This means that even if the probability to vote for the left is linked positively with education level, this link is weaker for higher income groups. However, it is not so much weaker because even though th line is downward slopping, it remains rather flat.\n\nNormally, the function plot_slope should produce the same graph:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_slopes(reg, variables = \"Education.level\", by = \"Gross.monthly.hh.income\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's do the same for income:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmarginaleffectsinc <- slopes(reg, variables = \"Gross.monthly.hh.income\")\ngame.inc <- marginaleffectsinc %>% \n  group_by(Education.level) %>% \n  summarise(mean.slopes.inc = mean(estimate),\n            conf.high = mean(conf.high),\n            conf.low = mean(conf.low)) %>% \n  ungroup() -> game.inc\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngame.inc %>% \n  ggplot()+\n  aes(x = Education.level, y = mean.slopes.inc)+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), alpha = 0.5)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(title = \"Group-average marginal effects of income\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere the result is more interesting: the average marginal slope of income is negative for each education level but this average decreases significantly for higher level of education. This implies that the probability to vote for the left is linked negatively with income group and that this negative link is strengthened by higher level of education. Rich and highly educated people have thus a very low probability to vote for the left.\n\nAnother way to look at the effect of the two independent variable on the probability to vote for the left is to look at the predictions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictionseduc <- predictions(reg, variables = c(\"Education.level\", \"Gross.monthly.hh.income\"))\npredictionseduc <- predictions(reg, by = c(\"Education.level\", \"Gross.monthly.hh.income\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(reg, condition = c(\"Education.level\", \"Gross.monthly.hh.income\"))+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")+\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.7),\n        legend.background = element_blank()) ->plotpredicteduc\n\nplot_predictions(reg, condition = c(\"Gross.monthly.hh.income\", \"Education.level\"))+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")+\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8),\n        legend.background = element_blank())+\n  ylab(\"\") -> plotpredictincome\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(plotpredicteduc, plotpredictincome)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](select2019analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
