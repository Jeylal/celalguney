One of the most growing debates is about economic growth: does Switzerland, as in other Western countries, suffer from economic slow-down, or even stagnation ? This was suggested in an article published in 2022 by the renown Swiss-German newspaper *Neue Zürcher Zeitung*. This article, written by Thomas Fuster and entitled *\"Immigration: The Swiss economy is primarily growing extensively\"* argued that the Swiss economy is growing \"extensively\", that is, only thanks to demographic growth and hence immigration. While economic growth, measured by the famous domestic product (GDP), is still growing due to immigration, GDP per capita growth remains near-stagnant because of the decline in productivity growth. This article provoked heated reactions among the neoliberal think thank *Avenir Suisse* and the business interest association *EconomieSuisse*, which responded through a series of articles offering an overview and a discussion of the performance of the Swiss economy in the last decades. Both EconomieSuisse and Avenir Suisse were eager to prove that Switzerland's economy is resilient, that extensive growth is still a fact, and that the country still hold its privileged position as the Swiss miracle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nData go back only to 1991, which is a shame since one cannot have an long-term overview of the dynamics of the wage share in Switzerland. In this post, I will try to construct longer series of the Swiss labour income share.\n\nBut first, let's ask why official data do not go back further than 1991 for Switzerland. There are, in my opinion, two possible explanations. The first explanation could be that the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) revised the Swiss system of national accounts in the 1990s. Swiss national accounts data before the 1990s are thus based on an ancient system, and mixing these data with the new system does not guarantee methodological coherence. However, this does not explain why the FSO still publishes long-run data mixing the ancient and new systems, as it does with [GDP](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases.assetdetail.27065074.html). Another explanation could be about the different measures of the wage share. The wage share data provided by AMECO is the *adjusted wage share*, which is different from the most basic measure of the wage share: the *unadjusted wage share*, which is:\n\n$$Unadjusted \\:wage\\:share = \\frac{Compensation \\: of \\: employees}{GDP}$$\n\nAccording the 2008 System of National Accounts (cite p.139), compensation of employees is the sum of two components:\n\n    1. Wages and salaries\n    2. Social insurance contributions payed by employers\n\n\nOne major issue with the unadjusted wage share is that it does not take into account the income received by self-employed. This measure is downwards-biased because part of the income of the self-employed belongs to labour income. This measure is hence only a lower-bound of the wage share and underestimates the latter. As a result, different methods have been developped to adjust the labour income share. In the Swiss case, however, the unadjuster LIS has the advantage to be calculated using long-term series by combining data of the old and new systems of national accounts offered by the FSO. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-wage-share-in-switzerland_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
