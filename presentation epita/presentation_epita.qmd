## Motivation

Multiplication of proposals for a social-ecological transformation and degrowth based on ecological planning

-   Mainly dedicated to find the good institutions and reforms to make the social-ecological transformation technically possible

-   But one major blind spot: the socio-political limits of those proposals

-   Finding the "good" institutions and policies is not enough, one needs to analyze institutional (ecological) change in a non-normative way

## The fundamental question

In other words, could a political strategy based on social-ecological planning aggregate a dominant social bloc ?

## Objective

Use the neorealist approach to institutional change [@amable_leconomie_2005; @amable_neorealist_2008; @amable_blocs_2024] to answer this question

-   An approach which has been proven useful to analyze institutional change from a political economy perspective

-   Institutional change conceived as the result of political, institutional and ideological conflict in a non-normative way

-   But how can "the environment" be integrated into this approach ?

## But how can "the environment" be integrated into this approach ?

1.  Through the identification of socio-political groups
2.  Through the three dimensions of social conflict: institutions, political mediation and ideology

# My argument

Further identifications of socio-political groups must take more indicators related to ecological issues

## 2. The three dimensions of social conflict

![How the social relation to the environment ("environment") integrates in relation to the three dimensions of social conflict (ideology, institutions, political mediation). Elaboration based on Amable and Palombarini (2024, figure 5.2, p.123)](diagram_translated_english.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Conclusion {.smaller}

An institutional ecological change approach ("neorealist political ecology") can be build on the neorealist approach by:

1. Considering more indicators related to ecological issues in the identification of socio-political groups

2. Considering the relationships between the social relation to the environment and the three dimensions of social conflict (ideology, institutions, political mediation)

::: fragment

Further issues:

- Finding good survey data with the good questions can be hard
- Still puzzled by the definition of "the environment" and the "social relation to the environment"
